## Description
This project is to develop machine learning methods to predict clinical trial duration based on registered study information, including study description, enrollment, study type, eligibility criteria, study plan, start date and so on. Simultaneously, we seek to understand the contributions of various features to prolonged trial durations and provide recommendations to optimize study protocols and reduce trial duration.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/TrialDuraPredict/TrialDuraPredict`, and go to repo dir `cd TrialDuraPredict`
- Create a virtual environment `virtualenv venv`, and activate it `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This installation is designed for macOS or Linux. Please adjust the commands accordingly if you are using Windows.

### Usage
to run the prediction model, use the following command:

```bash
xxx
```
