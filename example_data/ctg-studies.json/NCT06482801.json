Those drugs are regularly systemically administrated by vein infusion, however, local delivery of those drugs via interventional radiology technique including trans-artery or intra-tumor injection may increase the local drug concentration of the tumor, improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions. CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab has been widely effectively using to combine with PD1 or PDL1 antibody and this study is to combine ipilimumab and PD1 antibody or PDL1 antibody, so called double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy, as first line for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via intra-tumor admistration. To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been developed on the safety, efficacy and survival benefit of the double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy for cancer patients as first line via intra-tumor delivery. This phase II clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and survival benefit of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab or durvalumab combination with or without chemodrug or bevacizumab as first line therapy on patients with HCC, including PFS, ORR, DCR, and median survival time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Liver Cancer","Antibody"],"keywords":["Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Intra-tumor injection","First line","CTLA4 antibody","PD1 antibody","PDL1 antibody","chemodrug","anti-angiogenesis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IT injection of double ICI","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Arm 1: intra-tumor injection of double ICIs only.","interventionNames":["Drug: ipilimumab+pembrolizumab or ipilimumab+durvalumab, idarubicin, bevacizumab"]},{"label":"IT injection of double ICI and chemodrug","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Arm 2: intra-tumor injection of double ICIs and a chemodrug.","interventionNames":["Drug: ipilimumab+pembrolizumab or ipilimumab+durvalumab, idarubicin, bevacizumab"]},{"label":"IT injection of double ICI and chemodrug plus bevacizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Arm 3: intra-tumor injection of double ICIs, a chemodrug, and bevacizumab.","interventionNames":["Drug: ipilimumab+pembrolizumab or ipilimumab+durvalumab, idarubicin, bevacizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ipilimumab+pembrolizumab or ipilimumab+durvalumab, idarubicin, bevacizumab","description":"This study has 3 subgroups:\n\nArm 1.
