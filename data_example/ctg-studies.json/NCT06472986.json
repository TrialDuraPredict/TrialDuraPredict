Up to 24 individuals with SCI who suffer from tetraplegia will be treated with ABT-TCSCS. All participants will receive 12 sessions of ABT (4 weeks), followed by 28 sessions of ABT-TCSCS (7 weeks). Each session will last 1 hour and delivered 3 times per week. All study participants will be assessed at the start of the study (Baseline 1) and then re-assessed after 6 weeks (Baseline 2) to ensure that they are neurologically stable. The baseline assessment will consist of the International Standards of Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI), GRASSP Version 1, the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) and the TRI hand function test (TRI-HFT). Participants will be re-assessed after receiving 12 sessions of ABT i.e after 4 weeks (Pre-cervical stimulation assessment) and then after receiving 28 sessions of combined ABT and neuromodulation i.e after 7 weeks (Post-intervention assessment)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal Cord Injury Cervical"],"keywords":["stroke","cerebrovascular accident","CVA"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ABT-TCSCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The participants will receive activity-based therapy combined with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation.","interventionNames":["Other: Activity-based therapy and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Activity-based therapy and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation","description":"Activity Based Therapy (ABT) is a method of neuro-rehabilitation that incorporates a high intensity, long duration and effortful engagement from the individual receiving therapy, to garner improvements in sensory and motor function. The ABT constitutes 4 types of exercises including: cardio-fitness, resistance, postural/weightbearing and functional exercises. TransCutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (TCSCS) stimulates spinal networks in the cervical region to neuro-modulate the descending motor commands/motor intentions from the brain, which control the muscles. In tCSCS, electrical stimulation is delivered at a frequency of 30-50Hz at 500-1000Âµs between C3-C7. 12 sessions of ABT (4 weeks), followed by 28 sessions of ABT-TCSCS (7 weeks).
