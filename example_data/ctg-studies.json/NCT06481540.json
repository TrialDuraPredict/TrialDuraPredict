(2021) proved that the SpiroGym app was feasible for supporting expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Two weeks of intensive EMST coupled with SpiroGym were sufficient to significantly improve the participants' voluntary peak cough flow (PCF). The improvement was quantitatively comparable to the results of other intensive EMST studies with longer durations. When interpreting such rapid improvement, the impact of SpiroGym's visual feedback was considered. It was assumed that visual feedback increased training effort compared to regular training without immediate control. However, comparative studies were required to verify the possible additional effects of visual feedback on voluntary PCF compared to EMST without feedback.","detailedDescription":"Goal: To explore the visual feedback effect of the SpiroGym app in EMST on voluntary peak cough\n\nHypothesis: Voluntary peak cough flow will be higher at the 8-week assessment in the experimental group than in the active control group.\n\nStudy Design: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Voluntary Peak Cough Strength","mHealth"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants are randomly assigned to either the experimental or the active control group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"During the whole study protocol, patients did not receive information about testing the SpiroGym app. They will receive information that we are testing two types of expiratory muscle strength training programs.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Expiratory muscle strength training + SpiroGym application","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The experimental arm will undergo 8 weeks of expiratory muscle strength training coupled with SpiroGym app.","interventionNames":["Device: Expiratory muscle strength training + SpiroGym application"]},{"label":"Expiratory muscle strength training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The experimental arm will undergo 8 weeks of expiratory muscle strength training.","interventionNames":["Device: Expiratory muscle strength training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Expiratory muscle strength training + SpiroGym application","description":"Participants will performe an intensive home-based expiratory muscle training programme using an Expiratory Muscle Trainer (EMST150; Aspire Products, LLC, United States), which provide a pressure- threshold range from 30 to 150 cmH20.
