Age ≥ 12 years old\n2. Histologically-confirmed locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma scheduled to undergo resection or biopsy as part of standard of care\n3. Liposarcoma expansion cohort: histologically confirmed unresectable recurrent/metastatic liposarcoma scheduled to undergo resection or biopsy as part of standard of care\n4. Participants undergoing resection should have other measurable disease or be high risk for recurrence within 12 month per investigator assessment and has prior approval by PI.\n5. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 present prior to infusion of attIL12-TIL. If the only measurable disease is the same as the lesion biopsied for the study, it needs to be at least 2 cm in largest diameter.\n6. Participants must have received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy for the treatment of sarcoma, unless no standard therapy exists for a specific sarcoma subtype.\n7. At least 3 weeks must have elapsed since the last cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy prior to tumor tissue collection. For targeted therapies, at least 4 half-lives or 3 weeks must have elapsed prior to tumor tissue collection (whichever is shorter). Standard of care anti- cancer therapy will be permitted following tumor tissue collection but prior to initiation of cyclophosphamide such that at least 3 weeks must have elapsed since last cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy prior to starting treatment with cyclophosphamide. For targeted therapies, at least 4 half-lives or 3 weeks must have elapsed prior to initiation of treatment with cyclophosphamide (whichever is shorter). Investigational anti-cancer therapy will not be permitted.\n8. At least 2 weeks must have elapsed for palliative radiation to any tumor site other than the tumor site identified for tissue collection\n9. Participants must have organ and marrow function as defined below\n10. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1 K/uL, Hemoglobin \\> 9 g/dL, Platelets \\> 100 K/mm3\n11.

Participants with cognitive impairment, including adults with cognitive impairment such as trisomy 21 or similar conditions are not specifically excluded from participation, such that appropriate written informed consent is obtained from the parent or legal guardian and they are able to complete with the study protocol requirements and treatment.\n10.
