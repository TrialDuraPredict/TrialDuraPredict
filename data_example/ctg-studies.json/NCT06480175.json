Once confirmed with absence of motor response; 1 more ml of lidocaine 20 % is injected and then start our ablation for 180 sec at 80 degrees\n\nThe procedure will be done bilateral the same. After 2 weeks , patient will be readmitted and then the investigators will choose to inject the superficial cervical plexus with 5 ml of lidocaine 20% plus 40 mg triamcinolone. injection was random in the right or left side using ultrasound to confirm success.\n\nThe side of the block will be recorded for each patient either right or left. Comparison will be done between both sides to study the effect of adding superficial plexus block to radio-frequency whether the analgesic effect is better on the side of radio frequency alone or the side where the superficial cervical plexus block was added to radio-frequency.\n\nThe patients will then be asked to be followed up after 1 month and after 6 months and about the improvement in the numeric pain score (NPS) and the patient global impression of change (PGIC) and if they feel that one side is better than the other or they feel the same. Visual analogue score scale will be recorded for documentation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neck Pain","Cervical Spondylosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":53,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cervical plexus block","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"patients will receive cervical radiofrequency nerve ablation on both sides and after 2 weeks will be readmitted and will receive superficail cervical plexus block on only one side","interventionNames":["Procedure: cervical plexus block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"cervical plexus block","description":"patients will receive cervical radiofrequency ablation on both sides then after 2 weeks they will be readmitted and will receive superficial cervical plexus block on one side only","armGroupLabels":["cervical plexus block"],"otherNames":["radiofrequency ablation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pain releif","description":"evaluating degree of pain releif after cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation Monitoring pain score using numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) it is a 11 point scale scored from 0-10\n\n* 0 represents no pain\n* 10 represents the worst pain imaginable . versus radiofrequency plus superficial cervical plexus block by using numeric pain rating scale after 1 month","timeFrame":"1 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"improved life style","description":"Secondary outcomes that will be detected in our study is the degree of pain releif after 6 months Monitoring pain score using numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) it is a 11 point scale scored from 0-10\n\n* 0 represents no pain\n* 10 represents the worst pain imaginable .\n\n  * change the need for the use of oral or parentral analgesics","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"global impression of change","description":"measuring patient global impression of change ( PGIC) score: PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement.
