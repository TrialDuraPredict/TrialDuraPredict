Moreover, blood and muscle oxygenation status, as well as peripheral blood flow and cognitive function will be assessed.","detailedDescription":"After an exercise bout, angiogenesis is incredibly important in the recovery process as an increased number of capillaries enables higher metabolite transport to and from the working muscle. Often, a training strategy consists of living-high (sleeping at -stimulated- altitude) and training low (training at sea level). A decreased oxygen availability, also known as hypoxia, however poses an additional stress on the human body, potentially compromising the overall training efficiency. Ketones are recently found to increase angiogenesis in response to overload training (increased skeletal muscle capillarization and VEGF content) and to increase serum EPO concentrations. Therefore, the investigators want to evaluate the isolated and interactive effects of both ketones and hypoxia on post-exercise recovery and factors implicated in skeletal muscle angiogenesis, after training in normoxia. Moreover, a performance test will be performed after 7h of hypoxic or normoxic recovery by means of a simulated 15 min all-out time trial. During the 7h post-exercise window, biological samples are collected (muscle biopsies, venous blood samples, urine, capillary blood samples). Moreover, blood and muscle oxygenation, peripheral blood flow and cognitive function are assessed at regular timepoints."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ketosis","Hypoxia","Angiogenesis"],"keywords":["Exercise","Recovery","Living high training low"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"1 session with normoxic post-exercise recovery, supplemented with placebo (NPL)\n\n1 session with normoxic post-exercise recovery, supplemented with ketones (NKE)\n\n1 session with hypoxic post-exercise recovery, supplemented with placebo (HPL)\n\n1 session with hypoxic post-exercise recovery, supplemented with ketones (HKE)","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Both participants and investigators actively parttaking in the study are blinded.\n\nParticipants are misinformed that all sessions will be hypoxic, in order to prevent identification of normoxic vs hypoxic conditions.
