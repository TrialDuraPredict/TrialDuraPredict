This clinical trial is conducted at more than 2 centers in China, and patients who intend to be treated with liquid embolic system for cerebrovascular malformations are enrolled. Eligible patients are randomized into experimental group using Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge) or control group using Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Medtronic) in a 1:1 ratio. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":170,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge)"]},{"label":"Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Medtronic)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Medtronic)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge)","description":"Endovascular treatment with Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge).","armGroupLabels":["Liquid Embolic System (Tonbridge)"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Medtronic)","description":"Endovascular treatment with Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Medtronic).","armGroupLabels":["Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Medtronic)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Targeted Embolization Satisfaction Rate","description":"Targeted embolization satisfaction is defined as achieving ≥50% occlusion of the targeted embolized area after treatment with liquid embolic system, which is determined by immediate postoperative cerebrovascular DSA.","timeFrame":"intra-procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mRS score","description":"mRS scores are assessed at each evaluation time point.","timeFrame":"1 month±7 days, 3 months±30 days, 6 months±30 days, 12 months±45 days post-procedure"},{"measure":"GOS score","description":"GOS scores are assessed at each evaluation time point.","timeFrame":"1 month±7 days, 3 months±30 days, 6 months±30 days, 12 months±45 days post-procedure"},{"measure":"Operation satisfaction rate","description":"The 5-point Likert scale is used to evaluate operation satisfaction from three aspects: visualization, diffusion, and microcatheter withdrawal. \"Operation satisfaction rate\" is defined as the proportion of investigational devices or comparators with Likert score≥12 points.","timeFrame":"intra-procedure"},{"measure":"Incidence of major adverse events (MAEs)","description":"MAEs are defined as intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic complications.
