This would enable the construction and provision of an intervention model that closely aligns with the specific needs of this patient population.\n\nThe collected data will allow for the identification of individuals at higher risk of psychological distress and adaptation problems during the perinatal period, as well as potential impairment in the quality of the attachment bond with the child."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Perinatal Depression","Anxiety","Loneliness","Mother-Child Relations"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":134,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Women during pregnancy and postpartum","description":"Women during the last trimester of gestation (28th-35th week of gestation) and during the 18 months following the child's birth","interventionNames":["Other: Questionnaires and focus groups"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaires and focus groups","description":"Participation in the research involves completing a test battery composed of self-administered questionnaires, all validated in the Italian language.\n\nAdditionally, qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured interviews (conducted in person or online, based on individual preferences) and focus groups, both lasting between 90 and 120 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Women during pregnancy and postpartum"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Depression","description":"Levels of perinatal depression and of pregnancy-related anxiety","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"},{"measure":"Anxiety","description":"Levels of state and trait anxiety","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"},{"measure":"Loneliness","description":"Feelings of loneliness during and after pregnancy","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"},{"measure":"Defense mechanisms","description":"Nature of defense mechanisms during and after pregnancy","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Attachment bond","description":"Quality of prenatal of attachment bond and in the postpartum period","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"},{"measure":"Women subjective experience","description":"Subjective experience of pregnancy and postpartum","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"},{"measure":"Unmet needs of women","description":"Unmet needs of women during the perinatal period","timeFrame":"June 1, 2024 - December 31, 2025"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18 years or older\n* Adequate understanding of the Italian language\n* Willingness to participate in the study, expressed through the signing of the information sheet, consent declaration, and privacy statement\n* Women experiencing their first pregnancy\n* Women in the last trimester of gestation (28th-35th week of gestation) who will be followed for 18 months after childbirth\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age under 18 years old\n* Women who are not able to understand the Italian language\n* Absence of the willingness to participate in the study, expressed through the signing of the information sheet, consent declaration, and privacy statement\n* Women who are not experiencing their first pregnancy\n* Women who are not in the last trimester of gestation (28th-35th week of gestation)","sex":"FEMALE","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"We plan to recruit a sample of at least 134 patients.
