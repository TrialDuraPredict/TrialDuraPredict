Study 3.1: 25 male and female participants, age 18-35 years will be randomly consumed with control jelly, jelly with Tubtim Chumphae rice, and jelly with Hom Pathum rice at 3.5 g/kg body weight. All participants will be measured for blood glucose levels before consumption and after consumption at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Study 3.2: 25 male and female participants, age 18-35 years will be randomly consumed with control jelly, jelly with Tubtim Chumphae rice, and jelly with Hom Pathum rice at 3.5 g/kg body weight. After each consumption, all participants will perform walking or running on treadmill at intensity of 80% maximal heart rate to measure maximal oxygen consumption."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Facial Serum Application","Facial Mask Application","Jelly Consumption"],"keywords":["Thai rice"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Study 1 is single group model, study 2 is parallel model, and study 3 is crossover model.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":115,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study 1: Facial serum with alpha albutin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be randomly applied with home-based program of facial serum producing from 2% alpha albutin (standard facial serum) on either right side or left side of their face daily for 12 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Study 1: Facial serum with alpha albutin"]},{"label":"Study 1: Facial serum with Tubtim Chumpae rice extract","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be randomly applied with home-based program of facial serum producing from Tubtim Chumpae rice extract on either right side or left side of their face daily for 12 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Study 1: Facial serum with Tubtim Chumpae rice extract"]},{"label":"Study 2: Facial mask with Hom Pathum rice extract","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive home-based program of facial mask with Hom Pathum rice extract for 30 min/day, 2 days/week for 12 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Study 2: Facial mask with Hom Pathum rice extract"]},{"label":"Study 3: Control jelly","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will consume with control jelly at 3.5 g/kg body weight.
