The questionnaire examines 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity and knee function. According to this questionnaire, a score between 0 and 100 can be obtained, whereby a high score is associated with a high level of function and minor pain symptoms. A score of 100 is in fact interpreted as a condition in which there are neither limitations in conducting activities of daily living nor symptoms.","timeFrame":"baseline (post surgery)"},{"measure":"Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score","description":"The complete questionnaire consists of five subscales and covers: pain (9 items), symptoms (7 items of which two concern stiffness), functions and activities of daily living (17 items) physical function, sports and leisure activities (5 items) and quality of life in relation to the knee (4 items). All items of the relevant subscales have the same response mode, use a 5-point Likert scale and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates \"no difficulty\" and 4 \"severe difficulty\".)
