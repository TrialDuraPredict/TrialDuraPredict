This link between AKI and CKD has been established over the last decade3 and specific recommendations for the management of patients with AKI have been proposed in order to potentially influence this transition.4 To date, there are no specific pharmacological options for preventing or treating AKI, which is why new approaches and intensive efforts are urgently needed to reduce the occurrence of AKI. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines recommend implementing a bundle of different supportive measures, which, in theory, should be initiated in all patients with AKI in order to prevent disease progression. However, clinical practice and recent studies have shown that the implementation of the KDIGO bundle is still not standard clinical practice despite the fact that evidence suggest clear effectiveness in the reduction of AKI rates.5-9 Poor implementation of nephroprotective measures presents a major missed opportunity to reduce AKI-related morbidity and mortality and to improve long-term outcomes. To investigate the extent to which nephroprotective measures are implemented in patients with AKI can reduce the occurrence of persistent surgical AKI, a multi-center prospective cohort study will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Kidney Injury"],"keywords":["Acute Kidney Injury","KDIGO","Nephroprotective","Bundle"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Blood plasma, urine"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":257,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Critically ill patients","interventionNames":["Procedure: Nephroprotective measures"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Nephroprotective measures","description":"Due to the observational design of the study, no study specific interventions are performed.
