Appropriate staging of lung cancer is of paramount importance, as it customizes treatment and predicts prognosis.

The present research aims to compare the diagnostic and staging accuracies of (EBUS-TBNA) versus FDG-PET /CT as two diagnostic modalities in patients with suspected lung malignancies. However as a secondary outcome this study aims at monitoring the possible complications arising post EBUS-TBNA procedure.","detailedDescription":"Lung cancer is a prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality on a global scale.
