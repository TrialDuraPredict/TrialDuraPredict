The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nTo investigate patencies in patients with arteriovenous access flow dysfunction receiving ultrasound-guided fistuloplasty versus fluoroscopy-guided fistuloplasty at 6 months\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* be randomized equally to ultrasound-guided fistuloplasty group and fluoroscopy-guided fistuloplasty group.\n* visit clinic at one month, three month \\& six months for checkups and tests.","detailedDescription":"This is an experimental study employing a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of ultrasound-guided fistuloplasty compared to fluoroscopy-guided fistuloplasty in patients with arteriovenous access flow dysfunction.\n\nAfter assessing for eligibility, patients will be randomized equally with a ratio 1:1 to ultrasound-guided fistuloplasty group and fluoroscopy-guided fistuloplasty group.\n\nBoth interventions will be done in operation theatre to maintain sterility. After cleaning and draping the area of interest, local anaesthesia is given to the puncture site. A puncture needle is used to gain access to the arteriovenous fistula followed by a guide wire. Then, a sheath with an appropriate size is placed and a balloon catheter of adequate size is inserted over the guide wire and inflated for 2 minutes. Ultrasound is used in the subject group to monitor technical success. On table visualization of continuous segment of dilated vein to 5-6mm and continuous flow rate of more than 500ml/min signifies the end points of the procedure. Fluoroscopy is used in the control group to assess for technical success. On table fistulogram visualization of less than 30% recoil of the target lesion signifies technical success. After a satisfactory result, a figure of 8 suture is placed with manual inflow occlusion. Post procedure, patients will be observed for any signs of haematoma or bleeding. If there are no immediate complications, patients will be discharged on the same day."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fistulas Arteriovenous"],"keywords":["Endovascular treatments","Percutaneous","Ultrasound"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":54,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ultrasound-guided fistuloplasty","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After cleaning and draping the area of interest, local anaesthesia is given to the puncture site.
