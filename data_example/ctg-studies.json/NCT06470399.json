This 6-month randomized controlled trial included 160 participants diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Participants were divided into two groups: one received DS based on physician judgment, and the other based on GenAIS AI system analysis. Primary outcomes focused on changes in metabolic parameters, while secondary outcomes included individual components of metabolic syndrome, inflammation levels, body weight, and adherence to the DS regimen. Data collection involved genetic, metabolic, and clinical profiling, with ethical considerations ensuring participant confidentiality and informed consent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metabolic Syndrome"],"keywords":["AI-guided dietary supplementation","Metabolic parameters improvement","Genetic profiling","metabolic profiling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Standard therapy group"]},{"label":"AI-Guided Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: AI-Guided Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard therapy group","description":"Participants receive DS prescriptions from a physician based on current standard practices, which include biochemical markers, genetic data, and metabolic profiles.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"AI-Guided Group","description":"Participants receive DS prescriptions determined by GenAIS, is an AI system that considers genetic data, metabolic profiles, biochemical markers, and patient history.","armGroupLabels":["AI-Guided Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Composite Metabolic Syndrome Score","description":"This includes measuring and tracking changes in the five main components of metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins ( HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose.
