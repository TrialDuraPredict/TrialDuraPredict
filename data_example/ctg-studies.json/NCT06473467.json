The main questions were:\n\n* whether the increase in sedentaryism that occurred during the pandemic will persist after the pandemic ended?\n* whether the socioeconomic behavior patterns that emerged during the pandemic period will persist after the pandemic?","detailedDescription":"A questionnaire was created by experts in order to examine the predicted changes with a numerical tool and on large audiences. Totally, 765 adult individuals (452 female, 313 male) answered the questionnaire. In the created questionnaire, it was envisaged to evaluate the changes by asking demographic data, shopping habits, exercise habits and health problems in the pre-closure period, closure period and post-closure period.\n\nIn order to determine the changing shopping habits of the participants, they were asked what type of shopping they did and how often, face to face and online, before the closure period (before March 2020), during the closure period (March 2020- June 2021) and after the closure period up to 2 years (June 2021-June 2023). A 5-point Likert scale was used to determine shopping frequency, with questions ranging from 1 for Never; and 5 for allways. Shopping types are listed as Daily Materials (Grocery Shopping), Clothing, Electronics, Cosmetics - Personal Care products, Household goods - Furniture, Ready-made food (Food ordering at home) and Gifts - Toys.\n\nTo determine the sedentary tendency of the participants, movement habits that distract from sedentary life were grouped under three headings. These were determined as weekly active sports activities, weekly non-sports activities that are expected to require movement, and the number of daily steps. In the prepared questionnaire, participants were asked before the closure period (before March 2020), during the closure period (March 2020- June 2021) and after the closure up to 2 years (June 2021-June 2023); which sports they engage in and their total active sports time; They were asked which non-sport activities they engaged in, their total non-sport activity time and daily step count.\n\nIn order to determine the health problems of the participants, if any, they were asked about the health problems they experienced before the closure period (before March 2020), during the closure period (March 2020- June 2021) and after the closure period up to 2 years (June 2021-June 2023)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pandemic, COVID-19","Sedentary Behavior"],"keywords":["pandemic","socioeconomic behavioral changes","sedentaryism"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":765,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"shopping habit (type)","description":"what type of shopping the participants did face to face and online.Shopping types are listed as Daily Materials (Grocery Shopping), Clothing, Electronics, Cosmetics - Personal Care products, Household goods - Furniture, Ready-made food (Food ordering at home) and Gifts - Toys.","timeFrame":"before the closure period (before March 2020), during the closure period up to 2 years (March 2020- June 2021) and after the closure period (June 2021-June 2023)"},{"measure":"shopping habit (frequency)","description":"A 5-point Likert scale was used to determine shopping frequency, with questions ranging from 1 for Never;
