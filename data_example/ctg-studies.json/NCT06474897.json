The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Mulligan mobilization method and ozone therapy in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Ozone therapy will be practiced to study group. Mulligan mobilization will be practiced to control group. Pain, range of motion and function will be assessed before and after treatment.","detailedDescription":"The subacromial bursa and rotator cuff muscles are compressed between the acromion and the proximal humerus. If the subacromial surface volume decreases, degeneration and tears of the soft structures may occur during forward extension and rotation. Studies investigating the efficacy of the Mulligan technique and ozone therapy in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome are limited in the literature. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Mulligan mobilization method and ozone therapy in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Ozone therapy will be practiced to study group. Inject 10 ml of ozone gas (O2-O3) at a concentration of 10 µg/ml 3 times at one week intervals. All injections will be performed by the same experienced specialist doctor. Mulligan mobilization will be practiced to control group. Mobilizations will be performed once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. The first one is a seated position with the patient's arm in approximately 90° abduction. The patient will be asked to abduct the arm and at the same time the physiotherapist will perform posterio/lateral gliding of the shoulder head with the left hand. Pain, range of motion and function will be assessed before and after treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Impingement Syndrome"],"keywords":["Impingement Syndrome","Ozone therapy","Mulligan mobilization"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ozone therapy group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ozone therapy will be practiced to study group.
