Because of the limitations imposed by the complicated anatomical structure of the head and neck to the operation, radiotherapy (RT) has become the main treatment method for HNC. However, damage to the normal tissue surrounding the tumor is inevitable. The most common manifestations of injury caused by RT are mucositis with the dry mouth, loss of taste, and dysphagia. The severe dysphagia leads to a definitive total impossibility of eating through the mouth in 20-30% of patients. Radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM) is a common side effect after radiotherapy (RT) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. RIOM patients with severe pain have difficulty in eating, which increases the incidence of malnutrition and affects patients' quality of life and the process of RT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Head and Neck Neoplasms"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":47,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"patients of head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy , who did not receive any nutritional support during radiotherapy"},{"label":"nutritional support grouped","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"patients of head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy , who receive any nutritional support during radiotherapy whether oral or intravenous like dipeptivine for mucositis","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: various available nutrition as those contain high protein content as ensure milk"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"various available nutrition as those contain high protein content as ensure milk","description":"note effect with usually prescribed suitable oral and parenteral nutrition for head and neck cancers receiving radiotherapy","armGroupLabels":["nutritional support grouped"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"nutritional status of patients","description":"Follow up improvement by evaluating weight in kg and height in meters to calculate body mass index in kg / m\\^2","timeFrame":"two years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* head and neck cancer patients with age \\>18\n* Newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients\n* histological proven HNC cancer\n* head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemo radiotherapy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Advanced and Metastatic head and neck cancer patients\n* head and neck cancer patients treated with chemotherapy only","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Reham Mohamed, resident","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01069020384","email":"rehammohamed9891@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Asmaa Abdehtawab, lecturer","affiliation":"Assiut University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Reham mohamed","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Assiut","country":"Egypt","contacts":[{"name":"Reham Aboelela, resident","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01069020384","email":"rehammohamed9891@gmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":27.18096,"lon":31.18368}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Related Info","url":"http://rehammohamed9891@gmail.com"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"when research is publicly puplished","infoTypes":["SAP"],"timeFrame":"will be available after two years and used whenever it needed","accessCriteria":"at scientific research magazines"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006258","term":"Head and Neck Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9348","name":"Head and Neck Neoplasms","asFound":"Head and Neck Neoplasms","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M26955","name":"Mucositis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","asFound":"Quality of Life","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
