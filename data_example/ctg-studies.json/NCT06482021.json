Their age ranged from 40-60 years. Patients randomly will be divided into two groups: Study groups (A) 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with clinically proven peripheral neuropathy. And study group (B) 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with clinically proven peripheral neuropathy. They were selected from South Valley University Hospitals. Group A received low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy Li-ESWT (3 Hz, 0.09 mJ/mm2, 300 pulses), for two sessions per week for six weeks. Study group (B) received iontophoresis by acetylcholine current intensity of 3 to 5 mA. Check skin every 3-5 minutes for signs of skin irritation with (15) min for three sessions per week for four weeks. Nitric oxide level and the electrophysiology (EMG) of peripheral nerves and muscles were measured pre and post-treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Nephropathy"],"keywords":["Acetylcholine iontophoresis, shockwave"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"the study will be designed to compare the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy and acetylcholine iontophoresis on microcirculation changes as a possible new therapy for type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study group (A) Low-intensity shock wave group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Study group A will receive low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy Li-ESWT (3 Hz, 0.09 mJ/mm2, 300 pulses), for two sessions per week for six weeks.
