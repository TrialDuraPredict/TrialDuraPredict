Moreover, this project will also raise awareness on how insomnia symptoms, alone, and in interplay with factors such as function, psychological distress, physical activity, and fatigue impact on patient's prognosis and work ability. Our aim is that this knowledge can be used to design new interventions and improve rehabilitation programs for this patient group.","detailedDescription":"Insomnia is a vast problem among patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Despite the close relation between pain and sleep, sleep quality has received little attention in rehabilitation programs for patients with pain. So far, there is a lack of studies investigating the association between insomnia and chronic pain in patients referred to interdisciplinary rehabilitation. Identifying subgroups of the population with higher burden of poor sleep will aid clinicians to tailor treatment and prevention strategies. Moreover, knowledge on how insomnia symptoms fluctuate throughout the rehabilitation program and how insomnia symptoms interact with factors such as mental distress, physical activity, and fatigue impact on patient's recovery (e.g., the prognosis of pain, quality of life, and work participation) can be used to develop and implement more successful rehabilitation programs.\n\nThis is a cohort study primarily designed to address sleep problems in patients referred for pain rehabilitation by using questionnaire data from the rehabilitation centers linked to registry data. This study will constitute both a cross-sectional survey among patients referred to rehabilitation before they participate in rehabilitation. In addition to questionnaires, administrative data and clinical data, these data will be linked to national health registries on prescriptions, health care use and sickness absence. Potential participants are patients referred to rehabilitation at five different Unicare rehabilitation centers in Norway (Unicare Helsefort, Unicare Coperio, Unicare Hokksund, Unicare Friskvern and Unicare Jeløy) due to long-term pain complaints."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Musculoskeletal Pain","Insomnia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Unicare Helsefort","description":"Patients taking part in rehabilitation due to pain at Unicare Helsefort","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Inpatient rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Unicare Hokksund","description":"Patients taking part in rehabilitation due to pain at Unicare Hokksund","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Inpatient rehabilitation","Behavioral: Outpatient day rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Unicare Coperio","description":"Patients taking part in rehabilitation due to pain at Unicare Coperio","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Outpatient day rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Unicare Jeløy","description":"Patients taking part in rehabilitation due to pain at Unicare Jeløy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Inpatient rehabilitation","Behavioral: Outpatient day rehabilitation"]},{"label":"Unicare Friskvern","description":"Patients taking part in rehabilitation due to pain at Unicare Friskvern","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Outpatient day rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Inpatient rehabilitation","description":"Inpatient multimodal rehabilitation in specialist health care","armGroupLabels":["Unicare Helsefort","Unicare Hokksund","Unicare Jeløy"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Outpatient day rehabilitation","description":"Multimodal rehabilitation in specialist health care with program lasting whole work days","armGroupLabels":["Unicare Coperio","Unicare Friskvern","Unicare Hokksund","Unicare Jeløy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Insomnia","description":"Measured by Insomnia severity index (ISI)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Pain intensity","description":"Measured by visual analogue scale ( 0 to 100 scale)","timeFrame":"Baseline"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Health-related quality of life","description":"Measured by the the EuroQol EQ5D-5L questionnaire","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Fatigue","description":"Measured using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Function","description":"Measured by the patient-specific functional scale (PSFS)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Physical activity","description":"Measured by questions from the HUNT study","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Workability","description":"Measured by the workability index single item (self- assessed work ability on a 0-10 scale)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Symptoms of anxiety and depression","description":"Measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Prescriptions","description":"Use of sleep psychotropic medications, and pain medications based on registry data","timeFrame":"Up to five years before rehabilitation and one year after rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Sickness absence","description":"Use of medical benefits based on registry data","timeFrame":"Up to five years before rehabilitation and one year after rehabilitation"},{"measure":"Health care use","description":"Health care use in primary care based on registry data","timeFrame":"Up to five years before rehabilitation and one year after rehabilitation"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Take part in rehabilitation for long-term pain complaints at one of the five centers\n* Consented to research\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Potential participants are patients referred to rehabilitation at five different Unicare rehabilitation centers in Norway (Unicare Helsefort, Unicare Coperio, Unicare Hokksund, Unicare Friskvern and Unicare Jeløy) due to long-term pain complaints.
