Different technologies of with replete or depleted graft are associated with 7-20% of graft failures in different diseases. Fludarabine and busulfan conditioning is the most commonly used approach for a variety of diseases. In two previously completed trials of addition of either bendamustine and ruxolitinib to conditioning we observed low rates of primary graft failure with both approaches. The study is the direct randomized comparisons of these two approaches with the primary aim of reducing composite events of primary graft failure, relapse and non-relapse mortality. The stratas for the study are Disease Risk Index (DRI) and the age of the haploidentical donor (\\<35 vs ≥35)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","Acute Myeloid Leukemia","Biphenotypic Acute Leukemia","Lymphoblastic Lymphoma","Myeloproliferative Neoplasm","Myelodysplastic Syndromes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":220,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FluBeBu conditioning","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Days -7 through -2: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day iv x 6 days; Days -7 through -6: Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 iv x 2 days; Days -5 through -3: Busulfan 1 mg/kg po qid x 3 days;Days +3 through +4: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg iv x 2 days; Days +5 through +20: ruxolitinib 5 mg tid per os; Days +21 through 150: ruxolitinib 5 mg bid per os.","interventionNames":["Drug: Bendamustine Hydrochloride"]},{"label":"FluBeRux conditioning","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Days -7 through -2: Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day iv x 6 days; Days -7 through -2: ruxolitinib 5 mg tid per os; Days -5 through -3: Busulfan 1 mg/kg po qid x 3 days; Days +3 through +4: Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg iv x 2 days; Days +5 through +20: ruxolitinib 5 mg tid per os; Days +21 through 150: ruxolitinib 5 mg bid per os.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ruxolitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Bendamustine Hydrochloride","description":"Days -7 through -6: Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 iv x 2 days","armGroupLabels":["FluBeBu conditioning"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ruxolitinib","description":"Days -7 through -2: ruxolitinib 5 mg tid per os","armGroupLabels":["FluBeRux conditioning"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Event-free survival","description":"Measure: Kaplan-Meier estimate of either relapse, primary or secondary graft failure or death from all causes","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cumulative incidence of primary and secondary graft failure","description":"Cumulative primary and secondary graft failure, competing risk is death and relapse","timeFrame":"365 days"},{"measure":"Incidence of HSCT-associated adverse events (safety and toxicity)","description":"Toxicity assessment is based on presence of NCI CTC AE 5.0 event grades 3-5.
