medical history, physical examination, ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory determinations.\n* Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 kg/m2 to 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight ≥ 50 kg (110 lb), at screening. Given participants are postpartum, BMI accommodation up to 35.0 kg/m2 may be expected.\n* Has well-established lactation (ie, at least 4 weeks postpartum) and can produce stable milk product (ie, approximately 3 oz per 3 hours at screening) using the methods required for the study.\n* Is willing to exclusively pump breast milk for the 72-hour post dose period of milk collection during CRU confinement, and not to breastfeed or provide milk to infant until after CRU discharge (72 hours post dose).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Presence or history of any clinically relevant abnormality, condition, or disease (such as liver disease or abnormal liver function tests, or cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases) that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination of the study intervention, that would prevent the participant from participating in the study, or which places the participant at unacceptable risk if she were to participate in the study.\n* Current or recent (within 3 months of study intervention administration) clinically significant gastrointestinal disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact upon the absorption of study intervention.\n* Presence or history of mastitis, breast surgery or trauma, or other breast conditions, which are considered clinically significant by the investigator and/or, in the investigator's opinion, may significantly impact breastfeeding or collection of milk from one or both breasts.\n* History of biliary disorders, including Gilbert's syndrome or Dubin-Johnson disease, except for isolated gallbladder issues, which are not by themselves exclusionary.\n* Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"BMS Clinical Trials Contact Center www.BMSClinicalTrials.com","role":"CONTACT","phone":"855-907-3286","email":"Clinical.Trials@bms.com"},{"name":"First line of email MUST contain NCT # and Site #.","role":"CONTACT"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bristol-Myers Squibb","affiliation":"Bristol-Myers Squibb","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"BMS Clinical Trial Information","url":"https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/clinical-trials-and-research.html"},{"label":"BMS Clinical Trial Patient Recruiting","url":"https://www.BMSStudyConnect.com"},{"label":"FDA Safety Alerts and Recalls","url":"http://www.fda.gov/MEDWATCH/safety.htm"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"BMS will provide access to individual anonymized participant data upon request from qualified researchers, and subject to certain criteria.\n\nAdditional information regarding Bristol Myer Squibb's data sharing policy and process can be found at:\n\nhttps://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/clinical-trials-and-research/disclosurecommitment.html","infoTypes":["STUDY_PROTOCOL","SAP","CSR"],"timeFrame":"See Plan Description","accessCriteria":"See Plan Description","url":"https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/clinical-trials-and-research/disclosure-commitment.html"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"C000628674","term":"Deucravacitinib"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000003879","term":"Dermatologic Agents"},{"id":"D000047428","term":"Protein Kinase Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000004791","term":"Enzyme Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M346703","name":"Deucravacitinib","asFound":"S2","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7074","name":"Dermatologic Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25820","name":"Protein Kinase Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7951","name":"Enzyme Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Derm","name":"Dermatologic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
