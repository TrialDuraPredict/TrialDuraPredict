Minimally invasive endoscopic spine surgery has been widely implemented and promoted in hospitals at all levels. The learning curve of endoscopic spinal surgery is steep because it is performed in a narrow space adjacent to sensitive structures such as nerves and blood vessels. The surgical effect completely depends on the experience of the surgeon. How to break through the bottleneck and forbidden zone of endoscopic spine surgery and establish a perfect treatment system for endoscopic spine surgery has become one of the urgent problems and challenges in current spine surgery. At present, enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence, computer-assisted surgical navigation and robotics have been applied in spinal surgery, but their functions are limited to stereotactic orientation. Endoscopic spinal surgery robots that can meet the needs of intelligent surgical planning, precise decompression and flexible micromanipulation under endoscope are still lacking in the world. It is of great practical significance to develop an endoscopic spinal surgery robot platform with artificial intelligence characteristics, and based on this, establish an endoscopic spinal surgery treatment system oriented by accurate, safe and effective improvement of patient clinical outcomes, which is expected to improve the level of diagnosis and treatment of spinal surgery and promote the transformation and industrialization of a new generation of surgical technology. The objectives of this project include: 1) to conduct a real-world study on the precise decompression range of endoscopic spine surgery, to investigate the artificial intelligence-assisted spinal segmentation and automatic decompression planning for endoscopic spine surgery; 2) Develop a new generation of small interactive intelligent endoscopic robot system and supporting new minimally invasive surgical instruments, and study the human-computer interaction control strategy suitable for narrow space; 3) Carry out the effectiveness and safety research of the endoscopic spinal surgery robot, and verify it in model bones, animal bones and humans in general. The products are approved and clinical trials are completed after the relevant parts are filed. Finally, a small interactive endoscopic surgery robot platform and an intelligent decompression planning system were successfully developed, which clarified the scope and operation specification of accurate endoscopic decompression, provided guidance for the popularization of endoscopic surgery, and formed the operation process specification of small interactive minimally invasive endoscopic surgery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Spinal Stenosis","Lumbar Disc Herniation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"endoscopic spine surgery","description":"we would administer the endoscopic spine surgery to patients with Lumbar spinal stenosis and Lumbar disc herniation."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative 1-year incidence of complications","description":"the incidence of complications such as neural injury, postoperative bleeding, dural tear, wound infection etc, 1 year after the operation","timeFrame":"1 year after surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative lumbar spine function score","description":"We would measure the lumbar spine function score, such as SSM (Spinal Stenosis Measure), JOA (Japanese Orthopaedic Association), ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) and VAS (Visual Analog Scale), after surgery.
