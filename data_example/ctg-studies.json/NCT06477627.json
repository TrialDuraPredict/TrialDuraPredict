Oceans produce marine spray aerosols that contain a mixture of microbiota and natural biological molecules (biogenics). The primary outcome envisioned consists of 2 goals.\n\n1. In this study, our first objective is to determine whether the microbiota and biogenic molecules found in sea air are also found in the nasal swabs of the participants. In this way, we will gain an understanding of which sea air components are inhaled by humans and how this changes over time.\n2. Second, we want to get an idea of whether these inhaled sea air components have an effect on certain pathways in the human body. In our in vitro study with cell lines (Asselman, J., et al., Sci Rep-Uk 2019, 9), we already saw effects of sea air exposure on certain pathways in the body. Now the second goal of this study, is to see if we see changes in immunity biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10) in vivo in humans. We will do this by taking VAMS blood samples from the participants."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cytokines From VAMS Blood Samples, Microbiota and Biogenic Molecules From Nose Swabs"],"keywords":["Oceans and human health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"three groups: one group that lives at the coast all year round, one group that lives inland all year round and one group that live inland but in the month August lives at the coast (to investigate the change in environment) The participants will not get any treatment, they just have to give samples.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":190,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Studygroup that will move from inland to the coast for one month","type":"OTHER","description":"This group normally lives inland and live at the coast in august.
