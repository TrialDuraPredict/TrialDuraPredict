The collected data does not contain any personally identifiable information or compromise privacy. Additionally, this study design does not involve active intervention measures or patient recruitment. The study data is sourced from the electronic medical record system of hospitalized patients and has received approval from the hospital's research center, with ongoing supervision by the hospital's ethics committee. The study aims to investigate the correlation between preoperative blood glucose levels in hip fracture patients and postoperative complications.\n\nThe retrospective study aims to collect electronic medical record data spanning from January 2013 to November 2023. The data collection process is consistently monitored and verified by the hospital's ethics committee. Throughout the study, adherence to the ethical principles outlined in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration is ensured, and institutional review board (IRB) approval has been obtained for all aspects of the research.\n\nThe study aims to provide valuable evidence-based medicine for clinical practitioners by examining the relationship between preoperative persistent hyperglycemia in elderly hip fracture patients and postoperative delirium. Furthermore, it seeks to offer clinical insights for early identification and intervention management of high-risk postoperative delirium patients (POD)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Postoperative Delirium","Hip Fractures","Hyperglycemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2031,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hyperglycaemia group","description":"Blood glucose level ≥ 6.1 mmol/L"},{"label":"hypoglycaemic group","description":"Blood glucose level \\< 6.1 mmol/L"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants with Postoperative Delirium","description":"Postoperative Delirium (POD) manifests as acute cognitive dysfunction and consciousness disorder, characterized by changes in attention or consciousness that cannot be attributed to pre-existing cognitive impairments.
