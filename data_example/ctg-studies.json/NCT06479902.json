Thirty-seven participants from Fauji Foundation Hospital Rawalpindi underwent assessments before and after an 18-session treatment regimen over three weeks. The measures included diaphragmatic excursion, thoracic kyphotic angle, chest expansion, spirometry, and asthma quality of life questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mild Intermittent Asthma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Quasi Interventional Study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Core stabilization and Diaphragmatic Exercise Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention consisted of 18 sessions over three weeks, following the FITT protocol.
