However, the use of intravenous acetazolamide may not be possible in Indonesia, where the intravenous formulation is not available. This clinical research study is being conducted in single hospitals in Indonesia. We aim to learn if Oral Acetazolamide in addition to Furosemide intravenous works to treat congestion in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure, besides evaluating the total urinary output, change of NT pro BNP level, and safety profile of oral Acetazolamide.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is oral acetazolamide works well to achieve successful decongestion.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized, double blind study with 2 treatment groups. Participants diagnosed with ADHF who meet the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are given an explanation regarding the research and additional therapy that will be given, then informed consent is requested. Participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups by chance. Patients randomized to the first group will receive intravenous furosemide and oral acetazolamide. Patients randomized to the other treatment group will receive a combination of iv furosemide and placebo. It is expected that the patients of the treatment group with the combination therapy will have a faster reduction of their fluid overload. In consequence the treatment duration and total dose of diuretics administered will be shorter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Decompensated Heart Failure"],"keywords":["Oral Acetazolamide","Acute Decompensated Heart Failure","Congestion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This research is an experimental clinical study with a double blinded randomized controlled trial design.
