The impact of fibroids on female symptoms is generally high and often involves the removal of the patient's uterus. Hysteroscopic, laparoscopic or laparotomic myomectomy has always been a necessary and appropriate method for the patient's health, but controversial regarding pregnancy outcomes. There are many studies on the subject, but they have not drawn definitive conclusions.","detailedDescription":"AIMS:\n\n1. To investigate pregnancy outcomes in relation to surgical approach used for myomectomy.\n2. To investigate if pregnancy outcome is different in relation to time when myomectomy was performed: on a gravid uterus or on a non-gravid uterus\n\nPatients enrolled are divided in three major groups:\n\n* Group A: myomectomy outside of pregnancy-A1 hysteroscopic; A2 laparoscopic; A3 laparotomy\n* Group B: myomectomy during CS: B1 trans-endometrial; B2 serosal\n* Group C: control group with repeated CS\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1. women of reproductive age (up to 45 yrs)-all groups\n2. women who had myomectomy (group A and B)/CS (group C) at least two years before the enrolment\n3. myomas 30 mm in size and larger (groups A and B)\n4. Study groups: myomectomy performed as hysteroscopic/laparoscopic/laparotomic myomectomy or cesarean myomectomy, both using transendometrial or serosal approach: gravida 2 para 2 or gravida 1 para 1 \\[groups A1, A2, A3 and groups B1 and B2\\]\n5. Control group: women who had cesarean section in their second pregnancy-para 2 gravida 2, at least two years after the CS \\[group C\\]\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1. any previous surgery on reproductive organs except myomectomy\n2. any additional operation during cesarean myomectomy procedure except cesarean section\n3. history of endometriosis or PID\n4. coagulation disorders\n5. previous treatment for any malignant disease\n6. previous GTD\n7. premature ovarian failure or any kind of ovarian insufficiency necessitating oocyte donation\n8. systemic diseases: IBD, MS, DM\n\nDATA TO COLLECT:\n\n1. age\n2. years after myomectomy or CS(for group C)\n3. gravidity\n4. parity\n5. BMI\n6. myoma characteristics (size and type)\n7. myomectomy procedure\n8. gestational week at delivery\n9. primary indication for CS\n10. fetal position\n11. placental pathology\n12. preoperative hematologic values\n13. postoperative hematologic values\n14. duration of the CS\n15. myoma recurrence in groups A and B\n16. uterine rupture\n17. perioperative transfusion\n18. febrile morbidity\n19. postoperative hospitalization in days\n20. PPH\n21. cause of PPH\n22. uterine atony\n23. relaparotomy\n24. hysterectomy\n25. blood vessels ligation\n26. fetal presentation: cephalic/other\n27. neonatal body weight\n28. Apgar score\n\nOUTCOMES:\n\n1. pregnancy complications\n\n   1. placental pathology: placenta previa, placental abruption, PAS\n   2. PPROM (gestational age)\n   3. abnormal presentation: cephalic/other\n   4. uterine rupture: complete/incomplete\n   5. preterm/term delivery (gestational age at delivery)\n2. intraoperative complications\n\n   1. intraabdominal adhesions/PAI score\n   2. surgery complications: Claven Dindo classification\n3. other complications:\n\n   1. neonatal outcome,\n   2. duration of maternal hospitalization,\n   3. primary or secondary PPH\n   4. primary or secondary PPH\n   5. relaparotomy\n   6. peripartum hysterectomy,\n   7. ligation of major blood vessels (uterine, ovarian, iliac)\n\nThe study will be conducted as a multicentric observational study including cesarean section deliveries in each participating center. In each participating center, one person will be in charge for data collection and filling the SPSS database after obtaining the approval of the local Ethic Committee. As the study is observational and all the procedures will be conducted according to the local practice, informed consent from patients is not necessary.\n\nFollowing data collection and termination of the study, a single researcher will oversee the SPSS data collection for all the participating centers, checking the quality of data and submitting it for statistical analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Uterine Fibroid","Pregnancy Complications","Reproductive Issues","Reproductive Sterility"],"keywords":["Uterine fibroids, leiomyoma, hysteroscopic myomectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy, laparotomic myomectomy, reproductive outcome, pregnancy, complications"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","description":"Patients submitted to hysteroscopic, laparoscopic or laparotomic myomectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Myomectomy"]},{"label":"Group 2","description":"Control group"}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Myomectomy","description":"Patients submitted to operation of fibroids removal","armGroupLabels":["Group 1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pregnancy complications","description":"placental pathology, intraoperative complications, other complications","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. women of reproductive age (up to 45 yrs)-all groups\n2. women who had myomectomy (group A and B)/CS (group C) at least two years before the enrolment\n3. myomas 30 mm in size and larger (groups A and B)\n4.
