The time interval between the last blink and the initial distortion of the ring pattern was defined as first NIBUT. This variable was always measured at least 12 hours after administration of the study medication and the average of 3 consecutive measurements was calculated for statistical analysis.","timeFrame":"This outcome measure was analyzed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months."},{"measure":"Schirmer I test without anesthesia","description":"During the test, the patient is instructed to look upward while the test strip is carefully positioned between the palpebral conjunctiva of the lower eyelid and the bulbar conjunctiva. Subsequently, the patient is asked to keep their eyes gently closed for five minutes. After this period, the test strip is removed, and the Schirmer test score is determined by measuring the length of the moistened area on the strip.","timeFrame":"This outcome measure was analyzed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
