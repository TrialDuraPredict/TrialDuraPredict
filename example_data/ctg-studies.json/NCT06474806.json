The aim is that the diagnostic PET imaging agent may be used as an alternative or supplement to biopsies in the monitoring of patients with low-risk prostate cancer in active surveillance.\n\nPatients diagnosed with untreated, low-grade, localized prostate cancer may participate in the trial. The experimental diagnostic agent 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 is a radiopharmaceutical which is injected into the veins and binds to uPAR expressing cells in the tumour which can then be visualized in a PET scanner.\n\nThe main question the trial aims to answer is: Can the test drug be used alone or as a supplement to repeated biopsies to accurately assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer?\n\nThe trial is divided in 2 parts:\n\n* Participants in the first part will receive 2 injections of test drug on 2 different days.\n\n  * The first day the participant will receive an injection of the test drug and then be asked to lie down in the PET/CT scanner so that images of the prostate can be taken. Before and after the injection/scanning procedure the participant will have tests done. These tests will include evaluation of health status, measurement of heart function by ECG plus blood and urine samples.\n  * After 8 days the procedures, including injection of test drug and scanning, will be repeated.\n* Participants in the second part of the trial will only have 1 injection of the test drug and subsequent PET/CT scanning. Like in Part 1 of the trial, tests will be done before and after the injection/ scanning procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The trial consist on 2 parts: Part 1 will evaluate 3 different doses of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 in parallel (100, 150, or 200 MBq) in 27 patients (randomized 1:1:1) .
