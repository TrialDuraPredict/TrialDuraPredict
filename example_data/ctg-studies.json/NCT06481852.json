This trial will inform development of future trials of MTT as a treatment for PAH. 24 PAH patients will be randomized to receive either MTT with antibiotic preconditioning + fiber supplementation, MTT with antibiotic preconditioning + placebo supplementation, or placebo + placebo supplementation. MTT will in a capsule form composed of freeze-dried, encapsulated intestinal microbiota from healthy donors. Fiber supplementation will be 10-14 gm oral fiber supplement. Patients will be followed at week 1, week 2, week 4, week 12, and week 24.
