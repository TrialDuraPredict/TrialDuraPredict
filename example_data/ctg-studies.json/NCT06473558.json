These mental health conditions can be due to medical issues or can worsen medical problems. One way investigators hope to do a better job of learning about mental health is by training Artificial Intelligence (AI) software to detect anxiety and depression by analyzing facial expression and tone of voice.\n\nParticipants are invited to participate in a study which may help improve emergency department care. An audio and video recording of the participant's responses to some simple, non-psychological questions will be analyzed by a computer to determine whether investigators can assess mood and anxiety by analyzing speech and visual patterns. The audio and video will not be listened to nor watched by study personnel, only analyzed by a computer. The investigator's hope is that it will help others in the future by aiding in the assessment of psychological state. This study is being conducted at CMC ED only."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Artificial Intelligence (AI)"],"keywords":["Depression","Anxiety","Emergency Department"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Participants seen at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Emergency Department","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Eligible patients must present with non-emergent concerns of Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level 3, 4, or 5.
