Participants on cardiac myosin inhibitor should not be scheduled for up-titration during the trial.\n* Stable doses of background therapy (ie, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics) for at least 1 month prior to screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Received therapy with a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor within the past 8 weeks prior to screening.\n* Previous intolerance to an SGLT2 inhibitor.\n* Any previous treatment with sotagliflozin.\n* Current use of thiazolidinediones or digoxin.\n* Current/planned participation in another interventional clinical trial or prior participation in any interventional trial with an investigational agent within 45 days of screening.\n* Known infiltrative or storage disorder causing cardiac hypertrophy that mimics HCM such as Fabry disease, amyloidosis, or Noonan syndrome with LV hypertrophy.\n* History of unexplained syncope within 6 months prior to screening.\n* History of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia (\\> 30 seconds) within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Has paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and/or not adequately rate controlled within 3 months of screening.\n* Septal reduction therapy planned during the study period.
