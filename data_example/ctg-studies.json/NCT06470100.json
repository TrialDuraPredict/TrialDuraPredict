Peripheral nerve blocks have provided a safe, effective method to control early postoperative pain when symptoms are most severe.\n\nLocal anaesthesia's much lower toxicity threshold makes it essential for its safety. An effective adjuvant, such as Dexamethasone or Dexmedetomidine, could allow for a higher dilution of local anaesthetics while maintaining and enhancing their analgesic effect.\n\nThere is considerable research comparing intravenous and perineural dexamethasone and Dexmedetomidine use in orthopaedic surgeries. However, there is a massive lack of research regarding knee surgery and the Erector Spine Plane Block.\n\nIn this study, investigators compare perineural Dexamethasone and Dexmedetomidine.\n\nThe investigator aims to find a dexamethasone or dexmedetomidine that covers the need for good pain relief and fast recovery postoperatively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Knee
