The secondary purpose of the study was to verify the coincidence of the fluorescent photoelectric cervical lesion image detector with traditional colposcopic chemical staining.\n\nThis study is expected to include 20,000 participants with definite histological results, and compare the specificity and sensitivity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value of three cervical lesion screening methods, such as fluorescent photoelectric cervical lesion image detector, HPV nucleic acid detection and cytology detection. The advantages and disadvantages of fluorescent photoelectric cervical disease image detector, HPV nucleic acid detection and cytology examination were analyzed, and their application scenarios were provided to provide evidence-based medical support for the establishment of comprehensive prevention and treatment system of cervical cancer suitable for China's national conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Uterine Cervical Cancer","High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions","Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions","Photoelectric Detection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The cervical lesion was detected by fluorescence photoelectricity in the enrolled patients","description":"The enrolled patients were detected with fluorescence photoelectric cervical lesion image detector.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Detection of Cervical Lesions by Fluorescence Photoelectric Image"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Detection of Cervical Lesions by Fluorescence Photoelectric Image","description":"The enrolled patients underwent fluorescence photoelectric cervical lesion image detection, followed by colposcopy and biopsy to obtain histopathological results.
