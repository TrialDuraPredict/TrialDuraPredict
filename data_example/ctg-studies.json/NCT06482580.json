This study was designed as an experimental, 3-arm, parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled study that included a 6-week intervention period.","detailedDescription":"Participants will be randomly divided into 3 different groups (control group, foot-ankle exercise group, hip exercise group). The control group will be instructed to perform only short foot exercise; the foot-ankle exercise group will be instructed to perform 3-dimensional foot-ankle extension exercise in proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) pattern in addition to short foot exercise; the hip exercise group will be instructed to perform hip abductor and external rotator muscle strengthening exercise (oyster exercise) in addition to short foot exercise. Foot-ankle and hip exercises will be performed against resistance with the help of an elastic band, 3 days a week under the supervision of a physiotherapist and progression will be made by changing to a higher level of difficulty band color every 2 weeks. Short foot exercise will be performed every day of the week (3 days under the supervision of a physiotherapist; the rest of the days as a home exercise program) and will be progressed by changing position (sitting, standing, on one leg respectively) every 2 weeks. All exercises will be performed for 6 weeks. Assessments will be performed at the beginning and end of the exercises by another researcher blinded to group allocation. Isometric muscle strength of the intrinsic foot, four-way ankle circumference and hip abductor-external rotator muscles, endurance of the plantar flexors, forward jump and dynamic balance performance will be evaluated respectively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Flexible Flatfoot"],"keywords":["Foot deformities","Intrinsic foot muscle training","Muscle strenghening","Short-foot exercises","Performance","Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study was designed as an experimental, 3-arm parallel-group, double-blind randomized controlled trial with a 6-week intervention period.\n\nThe study will be conducted at Toros University physiotherapy and exercise laboratory.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The primary researcher will ensure blinding.
