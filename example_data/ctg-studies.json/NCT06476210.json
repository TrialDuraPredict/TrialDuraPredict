It will also learn about the safety of BDL regimen.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What is the percentage of participants with favorable treatment outcome at the end of treatment?\n2. What are the frequency and degree of AE and SAE associated with BDL regimen?\n\nParticipants will take Bedaquiline +Delamanid+ Linezolid for 6 months, option for 9 months for subjects who remain culture positive at month 4 to 6. Safety and efficacy data will be monitored and collected during treatment. A 12 month follow-up will be conducted after treatment completion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pulmonary Tuberculosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BDL interventionv group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: BDL regimen"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"BDL regimen","description":"Drug:bedaquiline 100mg tablets\n\nOther Names:\n\nBdq TMC-207 bedaquiline 400 mg once daily for 2 weeks then 200mg 3 times per week\n\nDrug:delamanid 50mg tablets\n\nOther Names:\n\nDlm OPC-67683 delamanid 100mg 2 times daily\n\nDrug:linezolid Scored 600mg tablets\n\nOther Names:\n\nLzd linezolid 600mg once daily","armGroupLabels":["BDL interventionv group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The efficacy outcome at the end of treatment","description":"The efficacy outcome of treatment: bacteriological positive patients completed the prescribed treatment course, demonstrating bacteriological response without evidence of treatment failure Notes: bacteriological outcome response:bacterial culture conversion to negative and no recurrence of positivity thereafter Bacteriological conversion refers to confirmed tuberculosis patients having two or more consecutive negative sputum culture results, with at least a 7-day interval between each Recurrence of positivity refers to two or more consecutive sputum cultures were positive after bacteriological conversion, with at least a 7-day interval between each","timeFrame":"Baseline (within 9 days before treatment initiation), weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 of treatment, thereafter every 4 weeks until week 26(or 39 weeks for patients require prolonged treatment) during the intervention"},{"measure":"Frequency of any adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring during the treatment period","timeFrame":"Baseline (within 9 days before treatment initiation), weeks 1-16, 20 and 26 during the intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of patients have bacterial recurrence within 12 months after treatment completion","timeFrame":"3,6,9,12 months after the intervention"},{"measure":"Time for sputum culture conversion to stable negativity during treatment","timeFrame":"3,6,9,12 months after the intervention"},{"measure":"Proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions or permanently unable to take the medication","timeFrame":"during the intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria\n\n* 1.A patient with multi-drug resistant/rifampicin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) with recent laboratory evidence (culture or molecular testing) within the last two months\n* 2.Age 18 years above\n* 3.No prior use of neither bedaquiline, delamanid, linezolid, or use for less than 4 weeks\n* 4.Positive culture result for mycobacterial at baseline(regardless smear positive or negative).
