The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. How do short exercise breaks affect executive function in college students?\n2. What changes occur in brain connectivity and microcirculation after these exercise breaks? Participants were college students who engaged in sessions of continuous sitting or sitting interspersed with exercise. The study used cognitive tasks and brain imaging techniques to measure the effects. The findings reveal improvements in cognitive performance and brain function, suggesting that short exercise breaks are beneficial in educational contexts."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sedentary Behavior"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"The study used a within-participant cross-over design with pre-and post-test comparisons. Participants completed the three following experimental conditions in pseudo-counterbalanced (cannot be completely counterbalanced given that an odd number of participants - hence, was pseudo-counterbalanced) order (odd number of participants) with at least a 7-day washout period between conditions: (i) 115-minute uninterrupted sitting \\[control\\]; (ii) 50-minute sitting + 15-minute moderate-intensity cycling + 50-minute sitting \\[experimental condition 1\\]; (iii) 50-minute sitting + 15-minute vigorous-intensity cycling + 50-minute sitting \\[experimental condition 2\\]. A familiarization session was completed about three days before the experiment started, during which participants were familiarized with the cognitive assessment and cycling protocols.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Moderate-intensity cycling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Moderate-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Moderate-intensity cycling","Behavioral: Uninterrupted sitting"]},{"label":"Vigorous-intensity cycling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vigorous-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Vigorous-intensity cycling","Behavioral: Uninterrupted sitting"]},{"label":"Uninterrupted sitting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Uninterrupted sitting in a quiet room","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Uninterrupted sitting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Moderate-intensity cycling","description":"Moderate-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","armGroupLabels":["Moderate-intensity cycling"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Vigorous-intensity cycling","description":"Vigorous-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","armGroupLabels":["Vigorous-intensity cycling"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Uninterrupted sitting","description":"Uninterrupted sitting in a quiet room","armGroupLabels":["Moderate-intensity cycling","Uninterrupted sitting","Vigorous-intensity cycling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cognitive function","description":"This primary outcome measure is assessed by the modified dual-task Stroop paradigm.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Retinal Vessel Diameter","description":"Retinal Vessel Diameter is assessed by the fully automated fundus camera.","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Brain Connectivity","description":"Brain connectivity is assessed by the NIRSport2 device","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n-right-handed (how was handedness assessed; i.e., \"What hand do you write with?\") with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal color vision\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-reported a history of cardiovascular, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, medical conditions requiring medical care, substance addiction, strict diets (e.g., low- carbohydrate and Mediterranean diet), pregnancy, or lactation.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"25 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Liye Zou, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"18823437684","email":"liyezou123@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Body-Brain-Mind Laboratory, School of Psychology, Shenzhen University","city":"Shenzhen","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":22.54554,"lon":114.0683}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"}},"hasResults":false}
