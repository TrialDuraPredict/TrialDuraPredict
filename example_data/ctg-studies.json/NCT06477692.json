Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary is not allowed.\n\n2. Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measureable disease at the primary site and/or nodal stations. Diagnostic lymph node excision (\\< 2 nodes) is also allowable. 3. Patients may undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic transoral resection for a T1-2 tonsil or base of tongue cancer. 4. Clinical stage I-IVB (AJCC, 7th edition); stages I-II glottic cancer are excluded 5. Age â‰¥ 18 years. 6. ECOG Performance Status 0-2 7. All men, as well as women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study treatment, and for 90 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n7.1 A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). 8. Neck CT and/or neck MRI, and PET-CT 9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Distant metastasis. Inability to undergo either a diagnostic CT with contrast or simulation CT with contrast. 3. Inability to undergo PET-CT. 4. Stage I and II glottic carcinoma. 5. Gross total excision of both the primary and nodal disease. 6. Synchronous non-skin cancer primaries outside of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx except for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer and synchronous well-differentiated thyroid cancer; in the latter case, surgery may occur before or after treatment, provided all other eligibility criteria are met.\n\n  7. Prior invasive malignancy with an expected disease-free interval of less than 3 years. 8. Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; prior chemotherapy for a remote cancer is allowable. 9. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation fields. 10. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents. 11. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the chemotherapy agents in this study (if necessary). 12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements. 13. History of severe immunosuppression, including HIV, and organ or autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"99 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sarah Neufeld","role":"CONTACT","phone":"214-645-8525","email":"Sarah.hardee@utsouthwestern.edu"},{"name":"Liliana Robles","role":"CONTACT","phone":"214-645-8525","email":"liliana.robles@utsouthwestern.edu"}],"locations":[{"facility":"UT Southwestern Medical Center","city":"Dallas","state":"Texas","zip":"75390","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Sarah Neufeld, MS","role":"CONTACT"},{"name":"David Sher, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.78306,"lon":-96.80667}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006258","term":"Head and Neck Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9348","name":"Head and Neck Neoplasms","asFound":"Head and Neck Cancer","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000017239","term":"Paclitaxel"},{"id":"D000002945","term":"Cisplatin"},{"id":"D000016190","term":"Carboplatin"},{"id":"D000068818","term":"Cetuximab"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000000972","term":"Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"},{"id":"D000000970","term":"Antineoplastic Agents"},{"id":"D000050257","term":"Tubulin Modulators"},{"id":"D000050256","term":"Antimitotic Agents"},{"id":"D000050258","term":"Mitosis Modulators"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"},{"id":"D000074322","term":"Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M18650","name":"Carboplatin","asFound":"System","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19537","name":"Paclitaxel","asFound":"Sessions","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M6182","name":"Cisplatin","asFound":"Healthy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M315","name":"Cetuximab","asFound":"Frequency","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M231","name":"Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26197","name":"Tubulin Modulators","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26196","name":"Antimitotic Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M1346","name":"Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"ANeo","name":"Antineoplastic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
