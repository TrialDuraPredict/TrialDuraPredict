The study involves a single timepoint of data collection and samples.\n\nThe study will have a total duration of 3 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Immune System"],"keywords":["thoracic tumors","Immune checkpoints","lymphocytes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Biological samples include: peripheral blood and tumor tissue.
