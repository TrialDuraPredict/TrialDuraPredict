The primary outcome was to observe the analgesic scores of the two groups of drugs as well as adverse reactions.","detailedDescription":"Mothers who met the study criteria vertebrae were included and then divided into two groups. Labor analgesia was provided by epidural anesthesia with a low concentration of local anesthetic (chloroprocaine or ropivacaine) combined with sufentanil. Data related to labor analgesia such as pain scores, motor tissue scores, and body temperature were collected and statistically analyzed to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of the two local anesthetics and to draw conclusions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstetric Labor"],"keywords":["labor analgesia","Chloroprocaine","Ropivacaine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":356,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chloroprocaine group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Selection of local anesthetics for epidural labor analgesia with low concentration of chloroprocaine combined with sufentanil","interventionNames":["Drug: Chloroprocaine"]},{"label":"Ropivacaine group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Selection of local anesthetics for epidural labor analgesia with low concentration of ropivacaine combined with sufentanil","interventionNames":["Drug: Chloroprocaine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chloroprocaine","description":"Selection of low concentration of chloroprocaine as local anesthetic for labor analgesia","armGroupLabels":["Chloroprocaine group","Ropivacaine group"],"otherNames":["Ropivacaine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of effective analgesia","description":"Percentage of effective analgesia within 30 min after the first epidural addition at the beginning of labor analgesia in both groups","timeFrame":"30 min after the first epidural addition at the beginning of labor analgesia"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primigravid women with full-term pregnancies scheduled for labor analgesia\n* Determination of labor onset to cervical dilatation ≤ 5cm;\n* Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score during contractions \\>50 mm (0 mm = no pain at all, 100 mm = most intense pain);\n* Age ≥20 years;\n* American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification II\n* Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2\n* Height \\>155 cm\n* Signed informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Twin or multiple pregnancies\n* Hypertension\n* Severe cardiopulmonary and hepatic or renal disease\n* Severe pregnancy comorbidities such as preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, placenta praevia, placental abruption, etc.\n* Cephalopelvic disproportion\n* History of allergy to local anesthesia\n* Spinal deformity\n* Contraindications to intrathecal anesthesia\n* Refusal to participate in the stud","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000077212","term":"Ropivacaine"},{"id":"C000004616","term":"Chloroprocaine"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000000779","term":"Anesthetics, Local"},{"id":"D000000777","term":"Anesthetics"},{"id":"D000002492","term":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"},{"id":"D000018689","term":"Sensory System Agents"},{"id":"D000018373","term":"Peripheral Nervous System Agents"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4107","name":"Anesthetics","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M1700","name":"Ropivacaine","asFound":"Eye","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M232383","name":"Chloroprocaine","asFound":"Ablation catheter","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19684","name":"Sufentanil","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4109","name":"Anesthetics, Local","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M117729","name":"Dsuvia","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"AdjAn","name":"Adjuvants, Anesthesia"},{"abbrev":"Analg","name":"Analgesics"}]}},"hasResults":false}
