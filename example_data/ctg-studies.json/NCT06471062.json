One of the least investigated aspects, however, is the mutual influence that two newly realized grafts can have. This possibility would be related to the presence of a more or less developed collateral circulation between the bypassed territories.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess whether a graft for a territory different than that provided by the left anterior descending artery (LAD) may affect the functionality (measured through flowmetry) of the left internal mammary artery - LAD graft."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease","Coronary Stenosis","Coronary Bypass Graft Stenosis"],"keywords":["coronary artery bypass","Transit Time Flowmetry","Intraoperative epicardial high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS)","Coronary anastomosis patency"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":135,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"LIMA>LAD Pulsatility index (PI) modification","description":"The primary aim of this study is to assess whether a graft for a non-LAD coronary target modifies the performance (measured by flowmetry) of the flow in the LIMA\\>LAD graft.\n\nPI is expressed by the ratio of the flow volume amplitude and mean flow volume, both quantified by a flowmeter (ml/min / ml/min).
