Optimize pulse sequence acquisitions for diffusion imaging on clinical MRI vendor systems.\n\nII. Develop image-based MRI models (including diffusion-based MRI) that accurately depict the multi-regional electrical properties in the brain (e.g., resistivity, current) to inform of neural integrity and function (including white matter tract integrity) in diseased and non-diseased states.\n\nIII. Compare/correlate image-based MRI models (e.g., diffusion) with existing structural, physiologic, and functional MRI methods (e.g., tensor imaging, fMRI, DSC-MRI, etc).\n\nIV. Validate image-based models/measurements with loco-regional benchmarks including (but not exclusive to) electrophysiologic monitoring, functional and structural tissue assays (from available biopsies), and correlative clinical features (e.g., histology, outcomes, treatment, etc).\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nParticipants complete a survey and undergo MRI on study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malignant Glioma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational","description":"Participants complete a survey and undergo MRI on study.","interventionNames":["Other: Non-Interventional Study"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Non-Interventional Study","description":"Non-interventional study","armGroupLabels":["Observational"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Identify diffusion MRI metrics [using conductivity tensor imaging (CTI)] that inform of regional electrical properties in the brain","description":"At least 4 normal white matter regions of the brain will be analyzed.
