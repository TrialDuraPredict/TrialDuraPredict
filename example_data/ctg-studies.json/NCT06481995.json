The goal is to determine if postpartum blood loss and PPH-related complications can be reduced by replenishing FXIII.\n\nAll participating women receive, according to the national guideline, 1g tranexamic acid (TXA) i.v. in case of PPH (measured blood loss \\[MBL\\] ≥ 500 mL) during the pre-study phase. Randomization takes place if bleeding continues and exceeds 700mL. The intervention group then receives FXIII (Fibrogammin®) according to approved dosage in addition to obstetric standard of care treatment for causes of PPH; the control group receives only standard of care treatment.","detailedDescription":"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a main reason for maternal mortality and morbidity. PPH, defined by the WHO as blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours after delivery, causes about 30% of maternal deaths worldwide. The internationally observed trend towards increased PPH-related morbidity and mortality is disturbing and demands new strategies in the prevention and treatment of PPH.\n\nAlthough the most frequent causes for severe PPH are believed to be uterine atony or retained placenta, virtually all cases of severe PPH lead to a disorder of the coagulation system which itself aggravates bleeding.\n\nAt the moment, most guidelines on coagulation management during PPH and expert opinions focus on the replenishment of coagulation factor I (fibrinogen) although three out of three randomized controlled trials with early or pre-emptive administration of fibrinogen during PPH were negative.\n\nBased on earlier research, it was hypothesized that coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) might play a significant role in women with increased postpartum blood loss, because of its role in the establishment of blood clot stability and fibrinolytic resistance. This hypothesis was tested in a prospective diagnostic study involving 1300 parturient women at the University Hospital Zurich and showed that pre-partum factor XIII activity had a strong association to postpartum blood loss.\n\nTherefore, this nationwide, multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial in major perinatal centers across Switzerland will be conducted. The goal is to determine if postpartum blood loss and PPH-related complications can be reduced by substitution of FXIII at an early stage of PPH.\n\nIrrespective of the answer to the question whether FXIII is effective in the treatment of PPH, this trial will contribute to enhancing the comprehension of coagulopathy in the context of PPH"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Postpartum Hemorrhage","Coagulation Disorder","Coagulation Factor Deficiency","Hemorrhage","Postpartum Complication"],"keywords":["Postpartum hemorrhage","coagulation factor XIII"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"multi- center, randomized, controlled","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The analysis of the primary outcome will be performed using blinded treatment arms.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":988,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fibrogammin (FXIII)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Women in the intervention group receive FXIII intravenously in addition to the standard of care treatment for PPH.
