It results from an irreversible degeneration of neurons responsible for a progressive decline in the main cognitive and memory functions due to a cerebral accumulation of plaques containing fibrillary amyloid peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of truncated, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (pTau).\n\nThere is currently no curative treatment for this disease in France. However, two treatments aimed at reducing beta-amyloid plaques in the brain have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The failure of the latest therapeutic strategies is largely due to the fact that the disease is diagnosed too late, starting with a long asymptomatic phase, which is the one that needs to be targeted in order to prevent irreversible neurodegenerative mechanisms.\n\nThe development of diagnostic tools is gradually making it possible to detect such a sequence, but this has its drawbacks (radioactive load, invasive procedure, cumbersome set-up).\n\nOver the last ten years, research has focused on the development of plasma or salivary markers. Although encouraging, these studies show either a lack of sensitivity or reproducibility, or a lack of specificity or precocity.\n\nThe expression of Aβ and Tau proteins has recently been demonstrated in the enteric nervous system and enterocytes. Intestinal Aβ is involved in various gut functions and regulation.\n\nWhat recent work by investigators demonstrates is the essential and hitherto unrecognized role of the gut-brain axis in maintaining brain homeostasis. In a mouse model of AD, the investigators have demonstrated a mechanism for intestinal elimination (clearance) of toxic brain forms of Tau and Aβ proteins, via the lymphatic network.\n\nThe clearance of cerebral Tau and Aβ proteins in the stool may constitute a reliable and powerful diagnostic signature of AD. Its study would represent a new, non-invasive and easily accessible technique for the early diagnosis of AD in humans."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alzheimer Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Feces"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":115,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"35 MA TCM (A+ T+)","description":"Group of patients with established Alzheimer's disease at the stage of major cognitive impairment","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: faecal analysis"]},{"label":"15 MA TCm (A+ T+)","description":"Group of patients with established Alzheimer's disease at the stage of minor cognitive impairment","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: faecal analysis"]},{"label":"15 TC Non MA LCR negatif (A- T-)","description":"Group of patients with minor or major cognitive impairment but without AD","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: faecal analysis"]},{"label":"15 TCm LCRdiscordant (A+ T-) ou (A- T+)","description":"Group of patients with minor cognitive impairment and discordant CSF","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: faecal analysis"]},{"label":"35 VS","description":"Group of healthy volunteers","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: faecal analysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"faecal analysis","description":"Collection of medical data and stool sampling","armGroupLabels":["15 MA TCm (A+ T+)","15 TC Non MA LCR negatif (A- T-)","15 TCm LCRdiscordant (A+ T-) ou (A- T+)","35 MA TCM (A+ T+)","35 VS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"to determine the amount of fibrillar and oligomeric amyloid peptide and phosphorylated tau protein measured in the stools of subjects issued as soon as possible after recruitment","description":"Quantity of AD biomarkers in stool.\n\nThe biomarkers studied will be :\n\nIn Lumipulse (CHUGA platform): beta-amyloid 42,beta-amyloid 40, Ptau and total tau.\n\nDotblot (GIN): Soluble forms of phosphorylated tau (Tau-pThre205, Tau-pThre181, Tau-pThre217, Tau-pser404) or total tau (panTau), as well as toxic oligomeric forms of the beta-amyloid peptide (E22P).
