Cohort A will receive TX103 exclusively through intraventricular (ICV) delivery, while cohort B will undergo dual intracavitary (ICT) and ICV delivery. Patients in each individual cohort will receive two TX103 infusions on Day 1 and 8 respectively, followed by a 14-day observation period in a 21-day treatment cycle.\n\nThree escalating dosage levels are planned for each cohort. Both Cohorts A and B will adopt the traditional 3+3 dose escalation design with each dose level enrolled with 3 to 6 patients. The starting dose will be 6 × 107 CAR+ T cells (i.e., Dose Level 1, DL1). Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed during the first cycle ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["High-grade Glioma","WHO Grade Ⅳ Glioma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"a \"3+3\" design is used to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort A Single delivery route","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Administration of TX103 via intraventricular(ICV) on Days 1 and 8 in a 21-day treatment cycle.","interventionNames":["Biological: Anti-B7-H3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (CAR-T Cell) Injection/TX103"]},{"label":"Cohort B Dual delivery route","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Administration of TX103 on Day 1 via intracavitary (ICT) and on Day 8 via intraventricular(ICV) in a 21-day treatment cycle.","interventionNames":["Biological: Anti-B7-H3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (CAR-T Cell) Injection/TX103"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Anti-B7-H3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell (CAR-T Cell) Injection/TX103","description":"3+3 dose escalation design： Dose Level 1: 6×10\\^7 CAR+ T cells Dose Level 2: 1.5×10\\^8 CAR+ T cells Dose Level 3: 2.5×10\\^8 CAR+ T cells","armGroupLabels":["Cohort A Single delivery route","Cohort B Dual delivery route"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety：Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)","description":"Type, incidence, and severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 28 days after the first TX103 infusion.","timeFrame":"28 days after the first TX103 infusion."},{"measure":"Safety：Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)","description":"To evaluate the possible adverse events after TX103 infusion, including the incidence, and severity of AEs.","timeFrame":"six months post CAR-T cells infusion."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"The proportion of subjects who have survived for more than 6 and12 months since the diagnosis of recurrent or progressive Grade 4 Glioma.","timeFrame":"6 and 12 months post CAR-T cells infusion."},{"measure":"Post-relapse survival (PRS)","description":"The proportion of subjects who have survived for more than 6 and12 months since the diagnosis of recurrent or progressive Grade 4 Glioma.","timeFrame":"6 and 12 months post CAR-T cells infusion."},{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","description":"To evaluate the time from the start of TX103 therapy to disease progression (according to RANO2.0 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.
