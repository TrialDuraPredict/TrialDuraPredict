The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDoes the intervention of food education change the nutritional status of the international students of the University of Pavia? Does the intervention of food education change the level of physical activity of international students of the University of Pavia? Does the intervention of food education change the possible risk of eating disorders related to the possible change of diet from the country of origin of international students? Researchers will compare the measurements done at the first meeting to the measurements made at the last meeting (6 months) to see if the food educational intervention helped the students.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* have the body composition analysed by anthropometric measurements (weight, height, electric bio impedance)\n* Receive personalized guidance and support from our team of experts for 6 months.\n\nVisit the clinic 3 times (beginning, 3 months, and by the end of 6 months) for check-ups and tests, and participate in online meetings the other 3 months (second, fourth, and fifth).\n\nAnswer online questionnaires and perform a 3-day food diary (beginning, 3 months, and by the end of 6 months)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Physical Inactivity","Eating Disorders","Eating Habit","Diet, Healthy","Diet Habit"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Food habits education regarding the Mediterranean diet adapted according to the country of origin.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Food education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Food education","description":"During the consultations are planned at least 6 nutritional education sessions in which the general nutritional advice provided by the Mediterranean Diet will be exposed, and some paper materials can be delivered according to the needs of each individual. 3 in-person meetings and 3 online meetings are planned.
