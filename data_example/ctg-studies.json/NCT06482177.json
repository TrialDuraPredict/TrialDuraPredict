fluorescein staining defined by the Oxford Scale Reduced tear break up time (TBUT) ≤ 10 seconds.\n\n* Able to comprehend and sign a statement of informed consent.\n* Willing and able to complete all required postoperative visits.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ocular surgery (e.g., intraocular, oculoplastic, corneal, or refractive surgical procedure) performed within the last 3 months or at any time that in the investigator's clinical judgment if it would interfere with the outcome measures of this study.\n* Clinically significant ocular trauma.\n* Active ocular Herpes simplex or Herpes Zoster infection\n* Ocular inflammation (uveitis, iritis, scleritis, episcleritis, keratitis, conjunctivitis) at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Ocular infection (e.g., viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, protozoan, or fungal infection or the cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, lacrimal sac or eyelids including hordeolum/stye).\n* Active, systemic, or local disease condition that causes clinically significant ocular surface irritation such that it could interfere with the study findings.\n* Moderate to severe (Grade 2-4) allergic, vernal or giant papillary conjunctivitis.\n* Severe (Grade 3 or 4) inflammation of the eyelid (e.g., blepharochalasis, staphylococcal blepharitis or seborrheic blepharitis)\n* Eyelid abnormalities that significantly affect the lid function (e.g., entropion, ectropion, tumor, edema, blepharospasm, lagophthalmos, severe trichiasis, severe ptosis).\n* Ocular surface abnormality that may compromise the corneal integrity (e.g., prior chemical burn, recurrent corneal erosion, corneal epithelial defect, Grade 3 corneal fluorescein staining, map dot fingerprint dystrophy, or the effect of any other ophthalmic medication that might in the opinion of the investigator compromise the ocular surface integrity).\n* Participation in this trial in the same patient's fellow eye\n* Patients who are under age 18, pregnant or breastfeeding, or who may become pregnant during participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
