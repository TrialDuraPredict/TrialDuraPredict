Once users sign up and respond to the initial assessment with PHQ-9 questionnaire, it reaches out to users proactively to offer support, personalized wellbeing plans, and guidance.\n\nIn partnership with the UWCCC, the IONA Mind Team, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) and the Head Neck Patient Advocacy team, the investigators propose adaptation of the IONA Mind app and pilot testing the app with 30 HNC patients and survivors. Using a mixed method design the specific aims are:\n\n* AIM 1. Adaptation of IONA Mind app for head and neck cancer. The research team will iteratively adapt the IONA Mind app to provide psychological support for HNC patients and survivors. The HNC Survivors Advisory Board will assist in identifying key aspects of the HNC survivors' journey from diagnosis to the survivorship phase, which will be prioritized and considered to iteratively redesign the IONA Mind phone app to better support HNC patients and survivors\n* AIM 2. Identify feasibility of the IONA Mind app for head and neck cancer. The IONA Mind app will be tested with 30 HNC patients and survivors, recruited from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) recruitment registry and from the clinical practice at UW Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC)\n* AIM 3. Determine preliminary efficacy IONA Mind app tailored for depression comorbid with head and neck cancer. Clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, weekly for 6 weeks (including the 6-week period of app utilization), and post-intervention follow-up conducted at 1- and 3-month post intervention using validated tools to access depression\n* AIM 4. Determine satisfaction and acceptability of the IONA Mind app. Satisfaction with the IONA Mind app will be measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS) delivered at 1-2 weeks following the completion of the app utilization. In addition, a qualitative interview for a random sub sample of 10 - 15 participants will occur shortly after completion of the intervention to assess satisfaction with and acceptability of the mobile app. A head and neck patient and survivor phone app Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (LiCBT) intervention to treat depression co-designed by HNC advocates, mental health professionals and an expert technologist is a critical outcome of this research."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Head and Neck Cancer","Head and Neck Cancers","Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IONA Mind app","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be asked to use the IONA Mind app for a 6-week period.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: IONA Mind app"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"IONA Mind app","description":"The IONA Mind app is a smartphone app that delivers mental health support.","armGroupLabels":["IONA Mind app"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility: Screening to enrollment ratio","description":"Recruitment and Retention Tracking Tool will calculate the screening to enrollment ratio.","timeFrame":"baseline"},{"measure":"Feasibility: Measured by Retention rate","description":"The Recruitment and Retention Tracking Tool will calculate the the number of participants who are recruited, dropped out, and complete the intervention.","timeFrame":"up to 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Feasibility: IONA Mind app Utilization in Minutes","description":"Minutes of app usage","timeFrame":"up to 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)","description":"Clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, weekly for 6 weeks during app utilization, and at post-intervention follow-up conducted at 1- and 3-month post intervention using the PHQ-9.
