The study included demographic and clinical variables of the participants. The implementation of Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence methods are used, and some specific implementations were designed for the analysis, where each group was characterized by traditional statistical methods."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COVID-19","Acute Kidney Injury"],"keywords":["machine learning","artificial
