Despite its benefits, it is contraindicated in cases of bleeding disorders, peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, severe heart failure, and advanced COPD. Effective postoperative pain management is crucial for faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs, using techniques such as intravenous or intramuscular analgesics, epidural analgesia, and local anesthetic injections like TAP block or M-TAPA block. The TAPA block, introduced in 2019, involves applying local anesthetic to the costochondral junction, affecting thoracoabdominal nerves, with a modified version (M- TAPA) applying anesthetic to the lower surface only. Studies have shown M-TAPA's efficacy in reducing pain and analgesic use postoperatively. Postoperative pain from laparoscopic cholecystectomy mainly arises from inflammation in the gallbladder bed and pneumoperitoneum. This study aims to evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy of intraperitoneal bupivacaine, bupivacaine with dexmedetomidine, and M-TAPA block by assessing pain scores and analgesic consumption in a prospective, randomized, double- blind trial with 45 patients. Patients will be assigned to three groups: M- TAPA block, intraperitoneal bupivacaine, and intraperitoneal bupivacaine with dexmedetomidine, with an experienced anesthetist administering the blocks and evaluating outcomes to compare these pain management techniques."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Regional Anesthesia Morbidity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"m-tapa","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: application for postoperative analgesia"]},{"label":"intraperitoneal bupivacain","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: application for postoperative analgesia"]},{"label":"intraperitoneal bupivacain+dexmedetomidin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: application for postoperative analgesia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"application for postoperative analgesia","description":"three different methods will be applied to reduce patients' postoperative pain","armGroupLabels":["intraperitoneal bupivacain","intraperitoneal bupivacain+dexmedetomidin","m-tapa"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"pain scores","description":"zero meaning \"no pain\" and 10 meaning \"the worst pain imaginable","timeFrame":"Time Frame: 24 hours after the procedure"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"total analgesic consumption","description":"total rescue analgesic consumption of patients will be evaluated","timeFrame":"24 hours after the procedure"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery planned\n* ASA #-II-III classification\n* Willingness to participate in the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Bleeding disorders\n* Signs of infection at the block application site\n* Conversion to open surgery\n* Allergy to local anesthetics\n* Unstable hemodynamics\n* Inability to provide informed consent","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M22662","name":"Dexmedetomidine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5315","name":"Bupivacaine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4032","name":"Analgesics","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Analg","name":"Analgesics"},{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
