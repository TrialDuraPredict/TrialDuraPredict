The study sample was derived from the population of patients who presented for evaluation and treatment of TMJ disorders. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: Group I (Control): patients treated by Hegab splint. Group II: patients treated by arthrocentesis with injection of HA/PRP mix plus Hegab splint. Group III: arthroscopy with injection of HA/PRP mix plus Hegab splint. The primary outcome variable was the change in pain using a visual analog scale, and improvement of maximum voluntary mouth opening. The secondary outcome variable was the change in joint sound. The third category of variables (age and sex) was evaluated in relation to the outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["TMJ Disorder","TMJ Disc Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: Group I (Control): patients treated by Hegab splint.
