One of the common opiates for pain relief, with a short half-life, is Remifentanil. However, following Remifentanil treatment an increased sensitivity to pain \\[hyperalgesia\\] appears. The aim of the study is to compare the effects between complementary treatments, like Ketalar and Dexmedetomidine, in preventing increased sensitivity to pain after Remifentanil treatment","detailedDescription":"Analgesia is one of the pillars of anesthesia. For many years, opiates were the basic ingredient in pain relief. The effectiveness of these substances in pain relief caused them to be overused which resulted in a global epidemic of addiction, morbidity and mortality due to the overuse of these drugs. Some of the options for realizing a reduction in the use of opiates include the use of drugs with a more predictable pharmacological profile and a short half-life, such as Remifentanil. This opiate is stronger than Morphine and its half-life remains within a few minutes, without accumulation even after prolonged infusion. Therefore, it seems that the use of remifentanil is ideal, especially for prolonged anesthesia.\n\nOne of the severe complications following treatment with Remifentanil is the appearance of increased sensitivity to pain \\[hyperalgesia\\] which results from a central sensitivity to pain and is expressed by stimulation of sensory receptors for pain in the nervous system (nociceptive sensitization). In order to alleviate the feeling of pain following the increased sensitivity to pain after treatment with opiates, as well as with Remifentanil, complementary treatments, such as Ketalar and dexmedetomidine, were offered. This study will compare the ability of Ketalar or Dexmedetomidine in alleviating increased sensitivity to pain after treatment with Remifentanil in patients who are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cholecystectomy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The patients will be classified into 2 groups:\n\nThe Ketalar group - who will receive, in addition to the general anesthesia, a bolus of Ketalar during induction and during the operation, continuous ketamine.\n\nThe Dexmedetomidine group - in addition to the general anesthesia, they will also receive a Dexmedetomidine bolus in the induction and during the operation continuous Dexmedetomidine","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The patients will not be exposed to the treatment arm they will receive","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ketalar","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"All patients will undergo general anesthesia using Fentanyl at a dose of 2 mcg/kg, Rocuronium at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg, Isoflurane during surgery and Remifentanil at a dose of 0.2-0.25 mcg/kg/min, 30 Minutes before the end of the operation, Morphine will be given at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.
