The index date is the initiation date of BDP/FF/GB, and subjects may have initiated treatment with BDP/FF/GB up to 12 weeks before enrolment. Baseline period is the 12 weeks prior to index date. The end of study (EOS) for each subject will be the earliest of the following: approximately 12 weeks after BDP/FF/GB initiation (the Week 12 Visit), BDP/FF/GB discontinuation plus 2 weeks, or at early withdrawal (such as consent withdrawal, death, or lost to follow-up)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"],"keywords":["Lung functions, COPD"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":359,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Effectiveness Measure","description":"COPD Assessment Test total score","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB on disease status"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Effectiveness Measure","description":"Number and percentage of responders (i.e. subjects with a change from baseline in CAT total score ≤ -2) or non-responders (i.e. subjects with a change from baseline in CAT total score \\> -2 or with CAT total score at Week 12 missing).","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"},{"measure":"Effectiveness Measure","description":"Mean absolute change from baseline in specific lung function parameter values (i.e. FEV1, FEV1 % of predicted, PEF) after 12 weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB.","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"},{"measure":"Effectiveness Measure","description":"Mean absolute change from baseline in specific laboratory parameter values (i.e. eosinophil count) after 12 weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB.","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"},{"measure":"Safety Measure","description":"Overall summary of AEs will be presented the number of subjects and percentage of subjects with any AEs.","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"},{"measure":"Safety Measure","description":"Overall summary of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) will be presented with the number of subjects and percentage of subjects with any ADRs.","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"},{"measure":"Safety Measure","description":"The number and percentage of subjects with any special situations will be summarised.","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Treatment Adherence","description":"Treatment adherence, by Test of Adherence to Inhaler (TAI)","timeFrame":"After 12-weeks of treatment with BDP/FF/GB"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
