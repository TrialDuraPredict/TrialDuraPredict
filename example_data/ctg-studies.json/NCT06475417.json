Following informed consent, patients will undergo screening to confirm eligibility. Subsequently, eligible participants will receive the standard dosage of Adebrelimab in combination with the DOS regimen for three cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Within 3-6 weeks after completing the third cycle, preoperative imaging will be conducted to assess the efficacy of the novel neoadjuvant treatment and feasibility of achieving radical D2 resection. Patients will then undergo radical surgical resection for gastric cancer, with pathological complete response (pCR) being observed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gastric Cancer"],"keywords":["Gastric Cancer","Resectable","Neoadjuvant","ICIs"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adebrelimab combined with DOS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After signing the informed consent, they are screened to meet the inclusion criteria.
