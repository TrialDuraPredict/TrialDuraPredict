Previous research suggests that probiotics can reduce plaque formation, gingival inflammation, and pathogenic bacterial load. By potentially improving the oral microbiome, probiotic toothpaste could offer a superior alternative to standard toothpaste for maintaining oral hygiene in orthodontic patients. Metal and ceramic brackets differ not only in aesthetics but also in their interaction with the oral environment. Ceramic brackets are more brittle and can be more prone to plaque accumulation due to their rougher surface compared to metal brackets. This study will determine the improvement in plaque levels utilizing Plaque Index Simplified scores in orthodontic patients using probiotic toothpaste and regular toothpaste.\n\nIt will further determine the mean difference in oral hygiene scores between metal and ceramic brackets in regular toothpaste and probiotic toothpaste groups.\n\nPlaque will be assessed using plaque disclosing tablets before the bonding (T1) and 3 weeks after the bonding (T2). The data will be collected on Plaque Index Simplified chart. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups.\n\nGroup A (Control): Participants will be advised to use regular toothpaste twice a day for 3 weeks after the bonding. A standard toothpaste and brushing technique will be conveyed to all the participants.\n\nGroup B (Intervention): Participants will be advised to use a Probiotic toothpaste twice a day for 3 weeks after the bonding. A probiotic toothpaste and brushing technique will be conveyed to all the participants.\n\nThe total sample size for each group would be 26. Since this study has 2 groups, a total number of 52 (N) will be required. Group 1: Regular toothpaste and Group 2: Probiotic toothpaste."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Plaque"],"keywords":["Plaque","Gingivitis","Probiotics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection (Control)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants will be advised to use regular toothpaste twice a day for 3 weeks after the bonding.
