The primary objective is to define immunodeficiency (phenotype and function of T cells) in patients with end-stage kidney disease. The second objective is to provide an in-vitro proof-of-concept of T-cell engineering in the context of end-stage kidney disease.\n\nThe study population was patients with chronic kidney disease.","detailedDescription":"The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression to this terminal stage (end-stage kidney disease, ESKD) remains a significant source of reduced quality of life and premature mortality. ESKD represents the complete and definitive alteration of renal function requiring the use of renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation).\n\nESKD is associated with a significant increase in mortality, with a death rate of 10.9% and a median age of 77 years. Thus, the average survival of patients with ESKD is lower than that of the general population. Among the causes of death in ESKD, infectious diseases represent the 2nd cause of mortality and are responsible for 15 to 20% of deaths. The occurrence of complications increases with the decline of renal function, although individual risk remains poorly characterized. Thus, after infection, ESKD patients are at increased risk of complications, hospitalization, and death. This susceptibility to infections is explained by a complex alteration of the immune system, including a pro-inflammatory state and immunodeficiency. However, this immunodeficiency is still partially understood. Premature-aged T cells were found, with a decrease in naive T cells and an increase in memory T cells, suggesting a more advanced T-cell differentiation than in the population of the same age.\n\nThe study aims to describe immunodeficiency in patients with ESKD in order to better assess the infection risk for each patient, particularly in patients awaiting kidney transplantation.\n\nThis is a comparative, prospective, non-interventional study. Three groups of participants will be included: 1) patients with ESRK, 2) patients with stage 3 CKD, and 3) healthy donors. Participants will be included after being informed and after obtaining no opposition to participate. Immunodeficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease will be performed from a single blood sample.\n\nA total of 100 participants will be included in this study based on the detection probability of naïve T cells (45% in patients with stage 3 CKD and healthy donors vs 10-15% in ESKD patients) and considered a power of 80% and an alpha risk of 5%.\n\nThe development of blood tests to evaluate the antiviral immune response could allow for the definition of new milestones for the development of future treatments or diagnostics for these diseases."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Kidney Diseases"],"keywords":["end-stage kidney disease","T-cells response","Immunodeficiency","Proof of concept of T-cell therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"For this study, the collection of blood samples is storage with specific samples :\n\n* Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)\n* Serum\n* Plasma"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"n°1 (ESKD)","description":"end-stage chronic kidney disease","interventionNames":["Other: 1 blood sample for each participant"]},{"label":"n°2 (stage 3 CKD)","description":"stage 3 chronic kidney disease","interventionNames":["Other: 1 blood sample for each participant"]},{"label":"n°3 (healthy donors)","description":"healthy donors","interventionNames":["Other: 1 blood sample for each participant"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"1 blood sample for each participant","description":"Blood sample for cohort n°1 and n°2 (collection during a peripheral venous blood sample, part of the standard of care for this disease) :\n\n1 blood sample for each patient 28mL of blood (4 tubes, 7mL per tube)\n\nBlood samples for cohort n°3 (collection during blood donation at Etablissement Français du Sang) :\n\n1 blood sample for each healthy donor 14mL of blood (2 tubes, 7mL per tube)","armGroupLabels":["n°1 (ESKD)","n°2 (stage 3 CKD)","n°3 (healthy donors)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary outcome is to characterize T cell immunodeficiency in our cohort of end-stage kidney disease patients from a phenotypic and functional point of view.","description":"Identify T cells and perform extensive phenotype.
