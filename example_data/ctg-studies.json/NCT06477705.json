The participants will perform a soccer training session \\[A single training session including 60 minutes of warm up, soccer technical exercises and small-sided game\\] and a cotrol trial (No intervention included, only daily measurements) in randomized, repeated measures, crossover design.","detailedDescription":"Football is an intermittent sport with frequent activity changes and a high number of explosive movements. As a result, both mitochondrial and the non-mitochondrial energy sources (phosphagens, lactic acid system) are heavily utilized during football practice and games, which may contribute to the rise of oxygen consumption following exercise (EPOC) compared with cardiovascular-type exercise, where VO2 can reach a steady state.However, it is observed that there is a methodological limitation in the determination of total energy expenditure during and after football training and specifically in overwight middle-aged participans with metabolic syndrome.\n\nTwenty overweight middle-aged males with mtabolic syndrome will perform a soccer training session \\[A single training session including 60 minutes of warm up, soccer technical exercises and small-sided game\\] and a cotrol trial (No intervention included, only daily measurements) in randomized, repeated measures, crossover design. Anthropometric, biochmeistry indicators, metabolic, blood pressure, physical activity and performance measurements will be measured at baseline. Global positoning system and accelerometry devices will be used to measure the distance and intensity of football trianing. The metabolic cost will be estimated from heart rate, blood lactate, resting oxygen uptake, exercise oxygen uptake, and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption measurements using a portable gas analyzer."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Energy Expenditure","Body Composition","Resting Metabolic Rate","Overweight and Obesity"],"keywords":["Football training","Energy Expenditure","Oxygen consumption","Blood lactate","Metabolic Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants in this arm will receive no intervention"},{"label":"Recreational Football Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this arm will participate in a football training session for 60 minutes.
