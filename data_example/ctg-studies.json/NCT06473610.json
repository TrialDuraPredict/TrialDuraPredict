These improvements have led to a shift from an acute to a chronic condition of venous thromboembolism, justifying the recent development of Chronic Thrombo-embolic Disease (CTED). In most of the situations, it is due to a residual pulmonary vascular obstruction (RPVO) which can be assessed by pulmonary scintigraphy.","detailedDescription":"Planar ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is the gold standard, but for several months, V/Q single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is recommended in the guidelines.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the performances of various SPECT protocols to quantified RPVO and compared to planar scintigraphy to evaluate the RPVO."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pulmonary Circulation Obstruction"],"keywords":["scintigraphy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":358,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RPVO (%)","description":"Evaluation of the RPVO establish with Meyer score (planar scintigraphy, 2D).
