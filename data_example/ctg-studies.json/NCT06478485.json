K-line(-) patients can be performed LAMP surgery for better prognosis if mK-line(+) and TypeⅠSC-line in MRI, but there are doubts on TypeⅡ and TypeⅢ. However, there has been no study that investigated the combination role of the mK-line and SC-line in surgical decision making for patients with MCSM. In this study, the investigators defined mK-line as a straight line connecting the midpoints of the anteroposterior canal diameter at cranial and caudal vertebrae of the open-door segment in MRI. Accordingly, the investigators propose a modified spinal cord line(mSC-line) that is a straight line connecting the postero-inferior point of the spinal cord at cranial and caudal vertebrae of the open-door segment in MRI, and simplify the mSC-line types into mSC-line(+) and mSC-line(-). In other words, mK-line and mSC-line in MRI are not fixed, but vary depending on the preoperative open-door segments. This study included patients with LAMP surgery for follow up, whose mK-line and mSC-line in MRI were double-positive for preoperative deciding open-door segments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Modified K-line and Modified SC-line in MRI"],"keywords":["mK-line","mSC-line","Multilevel Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MCSM","description":"This study collected MRI images and baseline information of patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM) and underwent Laminoplasty (LAMP) surgery in Nantong First People's Hospital.
