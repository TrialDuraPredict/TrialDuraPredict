The Herrmann Brain Model categorizes thinking styles based on the preference for utilizing brain quadrants, serving as an applied tool for residents to assess their learning preferences.","detailedDescription":"This study delineates the learning styles according to Herrmann's brain quadrant model among anesthesiology residents at the National Western Specialty Hospital, Mexican Social Security Institute. Cross-sectional descriptive study; the Herrmann Brain Dominance Test was administered to anesthesiology residents. Each brain quadrant embodies distinct characteristics, thinking patterns, and approaches to knowledge acquisition. The test comprises 120 multiple-choice items on academic, daily, and professional scenarios. The quadrants are described as follows: LC \"Scientific Expert,\" LL \"Organizer-Introvert,\" RC \"Interpersonal Strategist,\" RL \"Imaginative Communicator.\""},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Learning Problem"],"keywords":["Residency","Learning","HerrmannÂ´s Model","Medical Knowledge","Cognitive Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LC- Scientific Expert","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Herrmann Brain Model"]},{"label":"LL- Organizer-Introvert","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Herrmann Brain Model"]},{"label":"RC- Interpersonal Strategist","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Herrmann Brain Model"]},{"label":"RL- Imaginative Communicator","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Herrmann Brain Model"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Herrmann Brain Model","description":"The test comprises 120 multiple-choice items on academic, daily, and professional scenarios","armGroupLabels":["LC- Scientific Expert","LL- Organizer-Introvert","RC- Interpersonal Strategist","RL- Imaginative Communicator"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quadrant dominance","description":"Determine the learning style of each one of them based on the predominant cerebral hemisphere","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Anesthesiology residents of the National Western Specialty Hospital, Mexican Social Security Institute\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Residents of other specialties of the National Western Specialty Hospital, Mexican Social Security Institute","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Physicians between 27 and 32 years of age of both genders","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"National Western Speciality Hospital, Mexican Social Security Institute","city":"Guadalajara","state":"Jalisco","zip":"44329","country":"Mexico","geoPoint":{"lat":20.66682,"lon":-103.39182}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4107","name":"Anesthetics","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
