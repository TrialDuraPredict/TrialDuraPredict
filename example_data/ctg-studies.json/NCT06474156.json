Research questions are 1) How does treatment motivation of youth and parents develop over the course of forensic systemic therapy, and following the transition from inpatient to outpatient therapy?; 2) Which client factors, interpersonal factors, and contextual characteristics moderate the development of treatment motivation?; 3) Which mechanisms play a role in the development of treatment motivation?; and 4) How does treatment motivation affect treatment retention and the achievement of primary therapy goals?","detailedDescription":"Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) has been shown to motivate youth and parents in forensic care for treatment. The current study will investigate the development of treatment motivation of youth and parents over the course of MDFT, offered in a juvenile justice center. Furthermore, mechanisms and moderators will be examined, in addition to the impact of treatment motivation on treatment retention and goal achievement. Two studies with a Multiple Case Experimental Design (MCED), one with an ABC design (A = baseline, B = residential MDFT, and C = outpatient MDFT) and one with an AB design, will be conducted. Juveniles who enter residential MDFT, during a short detention period (study 1; 10 cases) or during a longer detention period (study 2; 6 cases) will be recruited, as will their parents."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Motivation"],"keywords":["Treatment Motivation","Multidimensional Family Therapy","Youth","Parents","Delinquency"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"9 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CROSSOVER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"short-stay residents juvenile justice center","description":"For the first group (first series case studies), ten short-stay residents will be included who enter residential MDFT and, after 1-3 months in the facility, continue MDFT on an outpatient basis.\n\nMDFT is a systemic intervention for juveniles and young adults exhibiting delinquent behavior and/or experiencing disorders related to alcohol and/or drug use.
