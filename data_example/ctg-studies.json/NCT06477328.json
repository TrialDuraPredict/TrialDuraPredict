It is designed to measure the impact of COPD on a person's life, and how this changes over time.\n\nRange of CAT scores from 0-40. Higher scores denote a more severe impact of COPD on a patient's life.","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who were diagnosed with COPD according to Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)\n* GOLD spirometric grade 3-4\n* At least one hospital admission in the past year\n* Acceptable score on the Mini-Mental State Examination\n* Residing in Ankara\n* Patient or caregiver must understand the process and be able to provide clear information\n* Medical records and laboratory test results must be accessible to healthcare professionals\n* Patient must have access to prescribed medications\n* Comorbidities outside of the lungs are included\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients diagnosed with asthma\n* Patients with lung cancer\n* Patients with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema\n* Patients with active infections such as pneumonia or COVID-19\n* Patients being followed for COPD without spirometry\n* Patients with low cognitive function as determined by the Mini-Mental State Examination\n* Patients who do not consent to participate in the study\n* Patients lacking adequate social support\n* Patients with COPD grade 1-2\n* Patients with no hospital admissions in the past year\n* Patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders\n* Patients residing outside of Ankara\n* Patients enrolled in inpatient or supervised outpatient rehabilitation programs\n* Patients unable to use telemedicine devices or without a caregiver to assist\n* Patients and caregivers having difficulty providing information\n* Patients without internet access or video call capabilities at home","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Gazi University","city":"Ankara","country":"Turkey","geoPoint":{"lat":39.91987,"lon":32.85427}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000008173","term":"Lung Diseases, Obstructive"},{"id":"D000029424","term":"Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000008171","term":"Lung Diseases"},{"id":"D000012140","term":"Respiratory Tract Diseases"},{"id":"D000002908","term":"Chronic Disease"},{"id":"D000020969","term":"Disease Attributes"},{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M11168","name":"Lung Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11170","name":"Lung Diseases, Obstructive","asFound":"Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M23449","name":"Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive","asFound":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M14977","name":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6147","name":"Chronic Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22700","name":"Disease Attributes","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","asFound":"Quality of Life","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"T1303","name":"Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC08","name":"Respiratory Tract (Lung and Bronchial) Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
