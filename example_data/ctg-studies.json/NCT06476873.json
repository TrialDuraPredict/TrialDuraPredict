It involves the use of psychoactive substances in a sexual context to enhance, initiate, facilitate or prolong sexual intercourse through the psychoactive effects of the molecules consumed. These molecules are essentially synthetic cathinones, GHB/GBL, MDMA, methamphetamines, cocaine and ketamine. These products are often used in combination with erectile dysfunction treatments (side effects of the molecules). This practice is thought to affect almost 20% of MSM.\n\nThis use has numerous social, somatic, psychiatric and addictive consequences. Studies have mainly focused on infectious risks, psychiatric complications (e.g. anxiety and depression) or the prevalence of this phenomenon. However, no study has assessed the prevalence of chemsex-related substance use disorders among these users."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Addiction Chemical","Use, Substance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"cohort","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Online self-questionnaire.","description":"Descriptive, cross-sectional study This study is aimed at adult chemsex users over the last 12 months (having experimented with chemsex at least once over the last 12 months) and with a good understanding of French.\n\nAn online LimeSurvey-type self-questionnaire will be accessible via a URL link to collect and secure the data.
