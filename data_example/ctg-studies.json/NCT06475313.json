The aim was to investigate the incidence of loss of contact between implant restorations and adjacent teeth and its influencing factors. Our findings may provide better insights for treatment planning and prevention of PCL.","detailedDescription":"Food impaction is a common complication after implant-supported restorations. Several studies have reported that more than 40%-66.9% of patients feel food impaction between the implant restoration and adjacent natural teeth. The most common cause of food impaction after implant restoration is the proximal contact loss(PCL), which has been reported to occur in 34% to 65% of cases. The location of PCL creates discomfort and leads to gingival inflammation and even peri-implant bone resorption, which ultimately leads to loosening of the implant. In our long-term clinical observation, not all final restorations suffer from PCL. The occurrence of PCL may be related to a number of factors such as age, gender, functional time, and so on. However, the literature addressing this issue is still limited. In this study, we collected and analysed the review results of selected patients who underwent implant-supported restorations in the First Hospital of Nanjing, China, to investigate the incidence of PCL between the implant restorations and the adjacent teeth adjacent , and the factors influencing it. Our findings may provide better insights for treatment planning and prevention of PCL."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Peri-Implantitis and Peri-implant Mucositis"],"keywords":["food impaction","proximal contact loss","Implant supported prosthesis","Dentition defect","risk factors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"plaque index assessment, periodontal probing, Bleeding on probing (BOP), Prosthetic adjacency check, initial occlusal contact, maximum occlusal contact, and filling of the cusps.","description":"oral panoramic radiograph","otherNames":["Radiation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"the proximal contact surface was adjusted by a dental floss (Reach waxed dental floss from Johnson & Johnson, standard thickness)","description":"The degree of proximal contact loss(PCL) was evaluated with a dental floss passing through the contact areas and classified as: (a) tight: sufficient resistance to the passage of the floss; (b) loose: insufficient resistance to the passage of the floss; and (c) open: contact: no resistance to the passage of the floss.
