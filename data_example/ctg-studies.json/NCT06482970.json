Fifty-nine participants with KOA will be recruited in a 1:1:1 ratio. Assessor, and statistician will be blinded to group allocation. One experimental group (n=19) will receive NME plus PNE, the other experimental group (n=19) will receive isolated NME and the control group (n=19) will continue with usual care. The PNE will be adapted to the context of the participants. Outcome measures will be brain activity, pressure pain threshold, pain intensity, disability, fear-avoidance beliefs, self-efficacy, and pain catastrophizing. Outcome measures will be evaluated pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and four-month post-intervention.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that there will be significant differences in favor of the NME plus PNE intervention group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Knee Osteoarthritis"],"keywords":["Neuromuscular exercise","Pain neuroscience education","Knee osteoarthritis","Chronic pain","Physical therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Neuromuscular exercise plus Pain neuroscience education","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Neuromuscular exercise will be carried out for eight weeks, with three weekly sessions, in groups (up to five participants per group).\n\nEach session will consist of three parts: warm-up, exercise circuit and cool down.
