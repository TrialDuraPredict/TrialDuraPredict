Oxford Scale Reduced tear break up time (TBUT) â‰¤ 10 seconds.\n\n* Able to comprehend and sign a statement of informed consent.\n* Willing and able to complete all required postoperative visits.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ocular surgery (e.g., intraocular, oculoplastic, corneal, or refractive surgical procedure) performed within the last 3 months or at any time in the investigator's clinical judgment if it would interfere with the outcome measures of this study.\n* Evidence of BAK or other chemical toxicity that, in the best judgment of the investigator, is causing reduced corneal sensitivity\n* Concomitant use of daily contact lenses that, in the best judgment of the investigator, is causing reduced corneal sensitivity\n* Clinically significant ocular trauma.\n* Active ocular Herpes simplex or Herpes Zoster infection\n* Ocular inflammation (uveitis, iritis, scleritis, episcleritis, keratitis, conjunctivitis) at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Ocular infection (e.g., viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, protozoan, or fungal infection or the cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, lacrimal sac or eyelids including hordeolum/stye).\n* Active, systemic, or local disease condition that causes clinically significant ocular surface irritation such that it could interfere with the study findings.\n* Moderate to severe (Grade 2-4) allergic, vernal or giant papillary conjunctivitis.\n* Severe (Grade 3 or 4) inflammation of the eyelid (e.g., blepharochalasis, staphylococcal blepharitis or seborrheic blepharitis)\n* Eyelid abnormalities that significantly affect the lid function (e.g., entropion, ectropion, tumor, edema, blepharospasm, lagophthalmos, severe trichiasis, severe ptosis).\n* Ocular surface abnormality that may compromise the corneal integrity (e.g., prior chemical burn, recurrent corneal erosion, map dot fingerprint dystrophy, or the effect of any other ophthalmic medication that might in the opinion of the investigator compromise the ocular surface integrity).\n* Participation in this trial in the same patient's fellow eye\n* Patients who are under age 18, pregnant or breastfeeding, or who may become pregnant during participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Leslie
