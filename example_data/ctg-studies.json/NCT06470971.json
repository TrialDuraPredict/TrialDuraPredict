Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The use of ICI therapy may lead to severe irAEs that can affect essentially any organ system in the body. Severe irAEs may lead to the early stopping of life saving treatment. Most patients that stop ICI therapy early will eventually progress and require additional treatment. Sometimes the decision is made to rechallenge with ICI therapy. Many patients who developed severe irAEs during initial ICI therapy are at risk for developing severe irAEs again during the rechallenge. Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to receptors for a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6). This may help lower the body's immune response and reduce inflammation. Giving siltuximab during ICI rechallenge may help prevent severe irAEs in patients with advanced cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether siltuximab prophylaxis reduces rates of de novo or recurrent severe irAE within 24 weeks of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy rechallenge.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of this combination including overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers such as baseline serum IL-6 level, C-reactive protein (CRP) suppression level, tissue IL-6 expression, stool microbiome, and antibody clearance rate.\n\nII. To assess changes in immune cell infiltration of irAE site pre- and post-treatment by multiomics profiling.\n\nIII. To assess patient-reported outcomes by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments.\n\nIV. To correlate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) levels with treatment responses.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy either every 3 or 6 weeks, or every 2 or 4 weeks per physicians choice. Patients also receive siltuximab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle prior to the administration of anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. Treatment repeats either every 3 weeks for up to 8 doses or every 4 weeks for up to 6 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo biopsy and bone scan on study, as well as blood sample collection and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 28, every 12 weeks for up to 2 years, and then every 6 months until 5 years following registration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Advanced Malignant Solid Neoplasm","Hematopoietic and Lymphatic System Neoplasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (PD1 antibody, PD-L1 antibody, Siltuximab)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy either every 3 or 6 weeks, or every 2 or 4 weeks per physicians choice.
