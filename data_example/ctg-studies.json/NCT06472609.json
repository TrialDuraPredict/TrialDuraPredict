More than one fourth of the patients with incident tuberculosis has diabetes mellitus. The latent tuberculosis infection treatment is recommended by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) of Taiwan to halt the transmission of tuberculosis in the community. Considering a relatively long delay in diagnosis of tuberculosis in clinical practice, eliminate the dormant tuberculosis germs a the stage of latent infection is the most cost-effective strategy to avoid tuberculosis transmission. The population with diabetes mellitus and inadequate blood sugar control are at increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection and activation and are encouraged to undergo latent tuberculosis screening and treatment. However, the anti-tuberculosis agents could have significant drug-drug interaction with the drugs used for diabetes mellitus control. The extent of its impact on blood sugar is still unclear. We aim to investigate the fluctuation of blood sugar during latent tuberculosis treatment with continuous subcutaneous sugar monitoring device to evaluate the possible associated risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia to enhance treatment safety. Inadequate blood sugar control is the root for immune dysfunction and render the patients vulnerable to infectious diseases. Hence, improvement in the blood sugar control not only leads to a better immune function to avoid tuberculosis infection but also reduce the risk of progression for cardiovascular and renal disorder. The present study proposed a protocol of 12-week aggressive blood sugar control and education program using phone call to improve the blood sugar control and life quality. Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis treatment for latent tuberculosis, we propose to evaluate the mycobacteria-specific antigen immune response by using the interferon-gamma releasing assay before and after anti-tuberculosis treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus","Latent Tuberculosis Infection","Continuous Glucose Monitoring","Quality of Life"],"keywords":["Diabetes Mellitus","Quality of Life","Latent Tuberculosis Infection","Continuous Glucose Monitoring"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Diabetic patients have had poor blood glucose control in the past year, and have a record of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C%) greater than 9%.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"interactive group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"diabetes, enhanced interactive education program through weekly phone call for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Behavioral: enhanced interactive education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"enhanced interactive education","description":"The present study is a prospective randomized open-label study.
