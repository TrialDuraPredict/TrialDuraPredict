Notably, DN can manifest even at the onset of T2DM. Peripheral neuropathy stands as the most common subtype of DN, impacting nearly half of all individuals with diabetes over their lifetimes, as per recent guidelines. The development of diabetic neuropathy (DN) involves various metabolic and cellular processes, including inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammation, characterized by cytokines and inflammatory cells, plays a role in DN progression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute significantly, with low levels of antioxidants exacerbating the condition. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) further damages nerves. DN leads to significant pain and discomfort for patients, yet current treatments often fall short of expectations. Improving treatment strategies is crucial to relieve suffering and improve the well-being of those affected by DN. Piracetam shows promise in managing diabetic neuropathy (DN) based on both preclinical and clinical studies. It may enhance central nervous system function by influencing neurotransmitter release, potentially alleviating DN symptoms. Additionally, piracetam's neuroprotective properties could shield nerve cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key contributors to DN nerve damage.","detailedDescription":"Ninety eligible patients will be randomly assigned to two groups:\n\nA) Piracetam Group (45 patients) receiving standard care plus 800mg Piracetam tablets thrice daily for the study duration, and B) Control Group (45 patients) receiving standard care plus a placebo for 3 months. Standard care involves insulin therapy with or without oral hypoglycemics and vitamin B complex supplementation.\n\nBaseline assessments will include age, weight, height, sex, race, baseline pain intensity, non-opioid analgesic use, diabetes medications, overall sleep quality, symptom duration, medication and medical histories, and laboratory tests such as HbA1c and fasting glucose levels. These assessments represent the outcomes of the clinical trial:\n\nPain intensity was measured using the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Vibratory sensation is assessed through the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Test (MNSI).\n\nQuality of life evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Sleeping disturbances related to diabetic neuropathy were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\n\nCognitive function was examined with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA).\n\nSerum biomarker levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) measured. The safety and tolerability of piracetam were assessed throughout the study. These assessments will provide valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of piracetam in managing diabetic neuropathy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy"],"keywords":["Diabetes","Peripheral Neuropathy","Piracetam"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Piracetam Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"receiving standard care according to the institution's protocol, along with 800mg oral tablet of Piracetam three times every day for the whole duration of the study ( 3 Months) Standard care includes insulin therapy with or without oral hypoglycemics and vitamin b complex.","interventionNames":["Drug: Piracetam"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"will receive standard care in accordance with the institution protocol in addition to placebo for 3 months.\n\nStandard care includes insulin therapy with or without oral hypoglycemics and vitamin b complex.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Piracetam","description":"800mg oral tablet of Piracetam three times every day for 3 months","armGroupLabels":["Piracetam Group"],"otherNames":["no other interventions"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"starch tablet","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of efficacy:1.

By summing the intensity values for the corresponding descriptors, sensory (11 items), affective (4 items), and total (15 items) pain scores can be obtained.","timeFrame":"3 Months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of efficacy: 2. Assessment of the vibratory sensation using Michigan neuropathy screening instrument","description":"Assessment of patients' vibratory sensation will be performed using MNSI,The MNSI consists of two parts, one of them a questionnaire for the patient, a higher score (with a maximum of 13 points) indicates a greater presence of neuropathic symptoms,and the second part is done by the examiner and contains physical examination tests,A high score on the questionnaire, reduced or absent vibration sense, reduced or absent ankle reflexes, and reduced or absent sensation on the monofilament test are all indicative of neuropathic symptoms, suggesting the presence of DN. Patients who score above 2 points on a 10-point scale in the clinical section of the MNSI are considered to have neuropathic symptoms .","timeFrame":"3 Months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of efficacy:3.

Within the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, there are five dimensions, and each dimension encompasses five response levels, ranging from 1 which indicates absence of problems to 5 which indicates Inability to perform/extreme problems","timeFrame":"3 Months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of efficacy: 4. Assessment of Pittsburgh sleep quality index Score:","description":"Sleep disturbance will be assessed,The PSQI questionnaire about usual sleeping habits for the past month only. These questions are consolidated to create seven distinct \"component\" scores, each with a scoring range of 0-3 points. It is important to note that a score of \"0\" indicates the absence of any difficulties, while a score of \"3\" signifies the presence of severe difficulties. Subsequently, the seven component scores are combined to generate a single \"global\" score, spanning from 0 to 21 points. Within this framework, a score of \"0\" indicates the absence of any difficulties across all domains, while a score of \"21\" signifies the presence of severe difficulties in all areas.","timeFrame":"3 Months"},{"measure":"Evaluation of efficacy: 5.

A score of less than 26 without associated functional impairment indicates a diagnosis of MCI. Furthermore, a score of less than 26 combined with functional impairment implies that dementia is in its early stages.
