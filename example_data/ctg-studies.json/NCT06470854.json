PDPH could be defined as severe positional headache that usually presents during the first 72-h following accidental dural puncture.\n\nDexmedetomidine (DXM) is a potent and highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist that was approved for ICU and procedural sedation in adults. Additionally, DXM has pleiotropic effects for its sympatholytic, amnestic, and analgesic properties. Regarding routes of administrations, DXM allows high flexibility and can be administered through intravenous (IV), intramuscular, buccal, intranasal and inhalational routes.\n\nNebulized DXM at 1 µg/kg is a favorable alternative to the intravenous route in short duration surgeries because it attenuates heart rate response to laryngoscopy. However, the effects of nebulized DXM on blood pressure are controversial.\n\nit was assured that it has a role in reduction of the intraoperative anesthetic requirements and analgesic consumption.\n\nThe prophylactic and management strategies for PDPH are heterogeneous because of the absence of clear guidelines and protocols for the management of PDPH. However, the general plan for PDPH management consists of conservative treatment and if failed invasive procedures such as blood patch were applied."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Post-Dural Puncture Headache"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group One","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Nebulized Dexmedetomidine"]},{"label":"Group Two","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Procedure: Bilateral greater occipital nerve block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nebulized Dexmedetomidine","description":"Nebulized Dexmedetomidine was prepared to provide 1 µg/kg and the calculated dose of DXM was diluted by 4-ml of 0.9% saline and was provided in the nebulizer to be nebulized in twice daily; i.e. every 12 hours for 72 hours","armGroupLabels":["Group One"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Bilateral greater occipital nerve block","description":"The injection solution was prepared by mixing 2-ml of 2% lidocaine with 2-ml (8 mg) of dexamethasone.
