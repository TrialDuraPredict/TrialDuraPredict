The aim is to evaluate the effect of an empowerment program based on the BASNEF model on children's knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, and practice of nail biting.\n\nA quasi-experimental study was conducted in the pediatric wards of Menoufia University Hospital and Benha University Hospital. A convenience sample of 135 children aged 6 to 18 was randomly assigned to two groups. The study group attended four empowerment sessions based on the BANSEF model, emphasizing age-appropriate information, fostering a positive attitude towards quitting nail-biting, discovering the subjective norms that influence nail-biting behaviors, and equipping children with enabling factors to quit. The control group received routine health education."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nail Biting"],"keywords":["BASNEF Model","Children","Knowledge","Nail Biting","Practice","Self-efficacy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":135,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Received the empowerment program based on the BASNEF model","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Empowerment Program Based on BASNEF Model"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"received the routine care","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Routine Health Education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Empowerment Program Based on BASNEF Model","description":"Initially, the researcher established rapport with children of both groups and their gradians, screened them for the eligibility criteria, explained the aim of the study, the duration and nature of the training sessions, and obtained informed assent.
