The main purpose of this study is to validate the molecular characteristics and biomarkers of phlegm-heat syndrome in ischemic stroke, and to demonstrate the association of biomarkers with clinical outcomes.","detailedDescription":"This is a cohort study in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The demographic characteristics, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes, and other baseline information will be recorded. At the same time, baseline peripheral blood will be collected. These participants will be followed up to 90 days of onset, and 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores will be assessed. The collected blood samples will be tested by multi-factor detection technology for candidate biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke,
