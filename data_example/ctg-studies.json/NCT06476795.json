Dietary flavanols can be obtained from the intake of foods such as tea, cocoa, wine, berries and apples. Incorporating Chardonnay Marc (the skins and seeds of Chardonnay grapes) into the diet can be an additional source of dietary flavanols. Like other flavanol-rich foods, Chardonnay Marc provides fiber and polysaccharides that may benefit gut health. We seek pilot data on the impact of the daily incorporation of Chardonnay Marc powder into the diet on markers of gut and cardiometabolic health.","detailedDescription":"The overall study objective is to obtain data on the impact of the dietary incorporation of Chardonnay marc on measures of gut and cardiometabolic health. Towards this goal, we will use an escalation design that will allow us to examine the effects of 6 - 12 weeks of daily Chardonnay marc intake on markers of gut permeability, inflammation and cardiometabolic health in obese individuals. Study procedures will be performed during 3 study visits conducted at baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks of Chardonnay Marc intake. For each study visit, 50 ml of blood (\\~3.5 tbsp) will be collected. For the first six weeks of the study, the participants will be asked to incorporate 1.5 g of Chardonnay Marc into their diet between the hours of 11 am and 4 pm every day. This level of intake will be increased to 4.5 g of Chardonnay marc everyday from weeks 6-12. Therefore, all individuals will consume Chardonnay marc for at least 12 weeks. We will instruct the participants to not cook or add the Chardonnay Marc to hot foods, however, they will be allowed to add the Marc to tepid or warm foods and beverages. We will also ask them to log their intake and how they incorporated the Marc into their diet via a log."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular Diseases","Adiposity","Cardiometabolic
