The probability of developing acute GVHD II-IV is above 40%, of which III-IV - above 15%\n2. The probability of 100-day transplant-associated mortality is higher than 20%. Goal Evaluation Date Intermediate analysis after 1 year from the beginning. The final analysis is scheduled to take place 100 days after the last patient is included.\n\nData Monitoring and Management\n\n1. Plan of initial examination of the patient\n\nAfter signing the informed consent and registration, the patient undergoes an examination in accordance with the standard plan of pre-transplantation examination and additional examinations, including:\n\n* Confirmation of remission status, determination of MRD, chimerism according to the protocol 1. Monitoring of donor chimerism in patients with acute leukemia Point Days Lines\n\n  1 +30 day general, CD34\n* Only if a relapse of the disease is suspected, cm can be sent to study chimerism:\n\n  * General\n  * Chimerism in the sorted MRD fraction 2. Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in patients with ALL +30, +100 days after HSCT - for all patients: MRD (immunophenotyping), Cytogenetics (if it presence)\n\n    + 60, +180 days after HSCT - for patients with MRD + or refractory before HSCT: MRD (immunophenotyping), Cytogenetics (if it presence) 3.

Biobanking (KM, blood)\n\nIn this protocol, in addition to routine post-transplantation monitoring, the following studies are carried out:\n\nâ€¢ Study of the subpopulation composition of peripheral blood lymphocytes: B-cells: CD19\n\nT-cells:\n\nCD3/4/8/ TCR/gd CD3/4/8/45RA/CCR7 (CD197) CD3/4/31/45RA CD4/25/127\n\nNK-compartment:\n\nCD3/CD56\n\nTCR repertoire:\n\nAnalysis multiplicity: +30, +60, +100, +180, +360 day The amount of blood for analysis is 5 ml in a test tube with EDTA.\n\n* Pathogen-specific immunoreconstitution research - ELISPOT method for evaluating the production of gamma-interferon by peripheral blood mononuclears after incubation with microbial antigens. The main antigens studied are (CMV pp65, EBV, Adenovirus (AdvHexon), BK virus) Multiplicity of analysis of recipients: +30, +60, +100, +180, +360. The amount of blood for analysis on +30 days is 10 ml, subsequently - 5 ml in a test tube with EDTA.\n* Virological monitoring by PCR weekly:\n\nBlood: CMV, EBV, ADV by PCR method Chair: ADV MONITORING by PCR is carried out up to 100 days after CGSC. The exception is patients with viremia, or receiving immunosuppressive therapy on day 100.\n\nin case of suspected visceral lesion: cerebrospinal fluid / bal / stool / urine / biopsy / other material\n\n* Biobanking Multiplicity: + 30, +60, +100, +180, +360 Blood in a test tube with EDTA, used 2. Toxicity monitoring:\n* Diagnosis and therapy of acute GVHD Clinical diagnosis and staging of acute GVHD is carried out in accordance with standard criteria (Appendix No. 3).\n\nWhen an isolated rash appears, a skin biopsy is mandatory. When a clinic of acute GVHD appears with damage to the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis), gastroscopy with a biopsy of the gastric mucosa and colonoscopy with a floor biopsy is reokended.\n\nThe biopsy material should also be sent for virological examination. Before starting therapy, a consultation is held with the head of the protocol / appointed expert.\n\nâ€¢ Criteria for prescribing systemic immunosuppressive therapy: Acute GVHD stage I - therapy is not carried out Acute GVHF stage II-IV - methylprednisolone 1-2 mg / kg / day IV The period for assessing the response to first-line therapy: 72 hours, 7 days, 14 days from the start of therapy.\n\nâ€¢ Criteria for prescribing second-line therapy: progression of manifestations of O.RTPH after 72 hours or no improvement after 7 days or incomplete resolution of clinical and laboratory manifestations after 14 days\n\nâ€¢ Diagnosis and therapy of chronic GVHD: Diagnosis and staging of chronic GVHD are performed in accordance with THE NIH criteria (Appendix No. 4). Due to the fact that the development of chronic GVHD is one of the main parameters for the evaluation of the study, the diagnosis and staging of chronic GVHD are performed prospectively, monthly from the day +100, using a structured examination in accordance with Appendix No. 2.\n\nTherapy of chronic GVHD is carried out in accordance with the standard adopted in the clinic"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","Acute Myeloid Leukemia","Biphenotypic Acute Leukemia","Malignant Lymphoma","Myelodysplastic Syndromes"],"keywords":["Hematopoetic stem cell transplantation","posttransplant cyclophosphamide","vedolizumab","hematoblastosis","ALL","AML","children","young adults","graft versus host disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Baricitinib and Cyclophosphamide","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Baricitinib 4 mg/day per os (patient age \\> 9 years), 2 mg/day (patient age \\< 9 years), from day -3 to day +90 (after HSCT), orally, once a day.","interventionNames":["Drug: Baricitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Baricitinib","description":"GVHD prevention using a combination of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide\n\nPrevention of GVHD:\n\nCyclophosphamide 80 mg/kg/course on the days +3, +4 Abatacept 10 mg/kg/day on the days +5, +14, +28, +60, +90 Vedolizumab 10 mg/kg/day, max. 300 mg on the days 0, +14, +28, +60 Baricitinib 4 mg/day per os (patient age \\> 9 years), 2 mg/day (patient age \\< 9 years), from day -3 to day +90 (after HSCT), orally, once a day.","armGroupLabels":["Baricitinib and Cyclophosphamide"],"otherNames":["Vedolizumab","Abatacept","Cyclophosphamide"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Estimate the probability of developing acute GVHD stage II-IV after HSCT","timeFrame":"100 days after HSCT"},{"measure":"side effects of conditioning","description":"Explore the safety based on an assessment of the frequency of occurrence of:\n\n- severe (3-5 degrees) side effects of conditioning during 1 month","timeFrame":"100 days after HSCT"},{"measure":"transplant-associated mortality","timeFrame":"100 days after HSCT"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"cumulative probability of relapse","description":"Probability of developing a relapse of the primary disease, transplantation-associated mortality on the horizon of 100 days","timeFrame":"after HSCT by day + 100"},{"measure":"cumulative probability of relapse","description":"Probability of developing a relapse of the primary disease, transplantation-associated mortality on the horizon up to 2 years","timeFrame":"up to 2 years after HSCT"},{"measure":"event-free survival","timeFrame":"after HSCT by day + 100"},{"measure":"event-free survival","timeFrame":"up to 2 years after HSCT"},{"measure":"Probability of engraftment of leukocyte","description":"cumulative Probability of engraftment of leukocyte of donor origin","timeFrame":"after HSCT by day + 100"},{"measure":"Probability of engraftment of platelet","description":"cumulative Probability of engraftment of platelet","timeFrame":"after HSCT by day + 100"},{"measure":"Probability of reactivation of CMV","description":"cumulative Probability of reactivation CMV","timeFrame":"12 months after HSCT"},{"measure":"Probability of reactivation of EBV","description":"cumulative Probability of reactivation EBV","timeFrame":"12 months after HSCT"},{"measure":"Probability of reactivation of AdV","description":"cumulative Probability of reactivation ADV","timeFrame":"12 months after HSCT"},{"measure":"Probability of reactivation BK","description":"cumulative Probability of reactivation BK","timeFrame":"12 months after HSCT"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nfollowing diseases:\n\n* acute lymphoblastic,\n* myeloblastic,\n* biphenotypic,\n* bilinear leukemia,\n* malignant lymphoma,\n* myelodysplastic syndrome, 2.
