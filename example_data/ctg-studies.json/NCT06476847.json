In South Africa while this is freely available in the public sector, persistence (that is continuation after initiation) is low amongst vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nThis study is a feasibility and acceptability study of a behavioral economics informed intervention to improve persistence amongst MSM newly initiating PrEP in South Africa. The goal of this study is to show that this approach is possible in a routine setting and gather the necessary data for a fully powered effectiveness trial.\n\nStudy participants will complete a baseline questionnaire and then be randomized to either receive standard of care (control) or to receive the intervention. The intervention package consists of evidence informed reminders, commitment pledges and planning prompts. The intervention package aims to address present bias, optimism bias and salience. The intervention is delivered and the enrollment visit and then through mobile phone reminders / text messages. There is no further in person interaction after the initial interaction. Participants may be contacted for a telephonic enplane questionnaire. Outcome data is obtained from passive followup through routine medical record review with the primary end point being persistence at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["HIV Infections"],"keywords":["Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)","Persistence","Vulnerable populations","Men having sex with men (MSM)","South Africa"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized into this group will receive a behavioral economics informed intervention to improve persistence among amongst high risk men newly initiating PrEP in South Africa.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: PrEP persistence"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual care for high risk men newly initiating PrEP in South Africa."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"PrEP persistence","description":"A light touch, once off, low cost. lay counsellor led intervention, designed to focus decision making around HIV prevention addressing present bias, salience and over optimism.
