While generally considered safe, this surgery can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in certain populations or healthcare settings. Understanding these outcomes and the factors influencing them is crucial for improving patient care and surgical practices.\n\nIn Algeria, the healthcare landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for evaluating surgical outcomes. Limited studies have specifically focused on the morbidity and mortality associated with cholecystectomy in this context. This study aims to fill that gap by providing comprehensive data on 30-day postoperative outcomes following cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder diseases in Algeria. Such data is essential for benchmarking current practices, identifying areas for improvement, and ultimately enhancing patient safety and surgical efficacy.","detailedDescription":"This study seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by offering detailed data on 30-day postoperative outcomes after cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder diseases in Algeria.
