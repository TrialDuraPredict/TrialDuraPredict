Therefore the aim of this project is to investigate whether ECC improves exercise capacity and possibly hemodynamics during prolonged rehabilitation programs in patients with PVD","detailedDescription":"Eccentric cycling exercise (ECC) allows training at low metabolic costs and may therefore be valuable for patients with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). For these patients, regular exercise training has an evidence level 1A recommendation in the current guidelines. Exercise training during longer and regular periods provides chronic adaptation, for which ECC was recently found to have a greater effectiveness than CON by increasing muscle strength, hypertrophy, six-minute walking distance and furthermore, by increasing maximum oxygen uptake (V'O2max) especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic left heart failure or coronary heart disease.\n\nFurthermore, the investigators conducted an RCT in which the investigators exposed patients with PVD to ECC and concluded that ECC is a feasible and well-tolerated exercise modality for PVD patients with severely lower O2 demand and load to the right ventricle.\n\nTherefore the aim of this project is to investigate whether ECC improves exercise capacity and possibly hemodynamics during prolonged rehabilitation programs in patients with PVD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Eccentric Cycling Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Eccentric cycling exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: Rehabilitation with eccentric cycling exercise"]},{"label":"Concentric cycling exercise","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Procedure: normal rehabilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Rehabilitation with eccentric cycling exercise","description":"Instead of normal cycling, patients will exercise on the eccentric bike.","armGroupLabels":["Eccentric cycling exercise"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"normal rehabilitation","description":"Normal rehabilitation will be conducted","armGroupLabels":["Concentric cycling exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"peak exercise capacity","timeFrame":"3 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Peak oxygen uptake","description":"Assesses during exercise until exhaustion using an incremental exercise protocol","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"ventilatory equivalent for CO2","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"Finger pulseoximetry","description":"Arterial oxygen saturation will be assessed by finger clip Infrared spectroscopy","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"6 minute walk distance","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"systolic pulmonary artery pressure","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"total pulmonary resistance","timeFrame":"3 weeks"},{"measure":"ventricular -
