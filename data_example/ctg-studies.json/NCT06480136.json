Subjects in this study were treated with SHR-A1921 in combination with adebrelimab until disease progression, intolerable toxicity occurs, informed consent is withdrawn, or other conditions requiring termination of medication, whichever occurred first. The maximum treatment time of adebrelimab is 35 cycles or 2 years (whichever comes first), and subjects can continue to be treated with SHR-A1921 until disease progression, intolerable toxicity occurs, informed consent is withdrawn, or other conditions requiring termination of medication. Primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of SHR-A1921 combined with adebrelimab in advanced NSCLC who failed the previous first-line standard therapy. Secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of SHR-A1921 combined with adebrelimab in advanced NSCLC who failed the previous first-line standard therapy; Exploratory objective of this study was to evaluate the biomarker changes during treatment with SHR-A1921 combined with adebrelimab in patients with advanced NSCLC who failed the previous first-line standard therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC"],"keywords":["Trop-2 ADC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SHR-A1921+adebrelimab","interventionNames":["Drug: SHR-A1921 injection and adebrelimab injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"SHR-A1921 injection and adebrelimab injection","description":"The Treatment group receive SHR-A1921 injection combined with adebrelimab injection","armGroupLabels":["Treatment group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective response rate","description":"Objective response rate represents the proportion of patients showing a predefined level of tumor shrinkage or disappearance in response to treatment.","timeFrame":"Screening up to study completion, an average of 2 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","description":"Progression-free survival measures the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease. without it progressing.","timeFrame":"Screening up to study completion, an average of 2 year"},{"measure":"Duration of response","description":"Duration of response refers to the length of time during which a patient's tumor remains in remission or shows a positive response to treatment.","timeFrame":"Screening up to study completion, an average of 2 year"},{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"Overall survival measures the length of time from the start of treatment until death from any cause, indicating the effectiveness of the treatment in prolonging patients' lives.","timeFrame":"Screening up to study completion, an average of 2 year"},{"measure":"Disease control rate","description":"Disease control rate refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink or stabilize for a certain period of time, including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) cases.","timeFrame":"Screening up to study completion, an average of 2 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
