The study will be run in two parts. Part A will assess if ETD001 is safe to give to people with CF, and Part B will assess if ETD001 improves lung function. The study drug is taken twice a day, in Part A it is taken for 7 days and in Part B for 28 days. In Part B there will be a separate period where dummy medicine is given for 28 days so the treatments can be compared.\n\nIn Part A participants will receive 13 doses of either ETD001 or placebo, 8 people will take part. Participants will take up to 56 days to finish the study and make 5 outpatient visits.\n\nIn Part B participants will receive 55 doses of ETD001 and 55 doses of placebo, 32 people will take part. Participants will take up to 140 days to finish the study and will make 8 outpatient visits.\n\nStudy assessments include physical examinations, vital signs, heart traces, blood/urine samples, breathing tests and health questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cystic
