8. Documented history of at least one asthma exacerbation requiring OCS bursts or requiring hospitalization within 12 months prior to Visit 1. An asthma exacerbation will be defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms that leads to any of the following:

   1. A temporary bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 consecutive days to treat symptoms of asthma worsening; a single depo-injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids

   3. Or, an in-patient hospitalisation (defined as admission to an inpatient facility and/or evaluation and treatment in a healthcare facility for ≥ 24 hours).

   Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements
9. Male or female.

   Female patients:
   * Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. Women of nonchildbearing potential are defined as women who are either permanently sterilised (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy) or who are postmenopausal. Women will be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months prior to the planned start date of the induction phase without an alternative medical cause.
   * The following age-specific requirements apply:

     * Women \< 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatment and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range.
     * Women ≥ 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatment.
     * Adolescents: if patient is female and has reached menarche or has reached Tanner stage 3 breast development (even if not having reached menarche), the patient will be considered a WOCBP.
10. WOCBP must be willing to use one of the methods of contraception described hereafter, from the time of signing the ICF throughout the study and 16 weeks after last tezepelumab administration:

    * Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, transdermal
    * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, implantable
    * Intrauterine device
    * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system
    * Bilateral tubal occlusion
    * Vasectomised partner (vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP patient and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success)
    * Sexual abstinence: it is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.
    * Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician

25. For women only: Pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating women. A serum β-HCG pregnancy test must be drawn for WOCBP at the screening visit. If the results of the serum β-HCG cannot be obtained prior to dosing of the IMP, a patient may be enrolled on the basis of a negative urine pregnancy test, though serum β-HCG must still be obtained. If either test is positive, the patient should be excluded. Since urine and serum tests may miss a pregnancy in the first days after conception, relevant menstrual history and sexual history, including methods of contraception, should be considered. Any patient whose menstrual and/or sexual history suggests the possibility of early pregnancy should be excluded.",

Sexual abstinence: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
