In this study, connective tissue massage and Mc Mennell joint manipulation technique were applied to the experimental group in addition to the home exercise program. The control group was offered only a home exercise program. The results of the study showed that the group in which connective tissue massage and Mc Mennell joint manipulation technique were applied were effective on hand functions, quality of life and mobility. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of connective tissue massage applied in addition to the exercise program.The study will include 30 patients diagnosed with scleroderma according to American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria and followed up in Fırat University Rheumatology Department. Patients will be divided into two groups; 15 patients in the first group will be applied connective tissue massage to the hand and forearm area in addition to the exercise program for hand rehabilitation. In the second group, 15 patients will only receive an exercise program.","detailedDescription":"Although there are various physiotherapy interventions in scleroderma rehabilitation, there is no definitive guideline. Passive and active stretching has been shown to help maintain range of motion (ROM) and optimal length of structures. Home exercises form part of rehabilitation in most studies. The only study in the literature that examined connective tissue massage in patients with scleroderma is by Bongi et al. In this study, connective tissue massage and Mc Mennell joint manipulation technique were applied to the experimental group in addition to the home exercise program. The control group was offered only a home exercise program. The results of the study showed that the group in which connective tissue massage and Mc Mennell joint manipulation technique were applied were effective on hand functions, quality of life and mobility. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of connective tissue massage applied in addition to the exercise program.The study will include 30 patients diagnosed with scleroderma according to American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria and followed up in Fırat University Rheumatology Department. Patients will be divided into two groups; 15 patients in the first group will be applied connective tissue massage to the hand and forearm area in addition to the exercise program for hand rehabilitation. In the second group, 15 patients will only receive an exercise program. Range of motion, skin thickness and hand mobility test will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Scleroderma"],"keywords":["Scleroderma","Connective tissue massage","mobility"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Connective tissue massage group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to the exercise program for hand rehabilitation, 15 patients in this group will receive connective tissue massage of the hand and forearm area.
