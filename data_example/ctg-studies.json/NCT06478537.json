After 24-week TPO-RA treatment, all patients with a platelet count of ≥ 50 × 10\\^9/L after two consecutive visits will enter an 8-week reduction period. All patients who successfully discontinued the drug and maintained their platelet count at ≥30×109/L entered the efficacy and safety follow-up period.\n\nThe aim is to investigate whether this strategy could lead to the development or achievement of immune tolerance, achieving sustained response off treatment (SROT) (PLT≥50×109/L, no other ITP-specific medications, no bleeding) after TPO-RA discontinuation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Immune Thrombocytopenia"],"keywords":["immune thrombocytopenia","thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA)","hetrombopag"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"hetrombopag treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Hetrombopag Olamine","Drug: Aspirin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Hetrombopag Olamine","description":"Treatment period: 24-week Hetrombopag (2.5mg/d\\~7.5mg/d) treatment.\n\n* Two consecutive visits with PLT\\>600 × 10\\^9/L: daily dose reduction of 2.5mg; If the lowest dose has been used, extend the dosing interval.\n* Two consecutive visits with PLT\\<300 × 10\\^9/L: increase the daily dose by 2.5mg until the maximum dose is reached.\n* Two consecutive visits with PLT\\<50 × 10\\^9/L: increase the daily dose by 2.5mg until the maximum dose is reached; If PLT is still\\<50 × 10\\^9/L with7.5mg/d × 28d, the patient will be withdrawn.\n\nDrug discontinuation period：8-week Hetrombopag (2.5mg/d\\~7.5mg/d) reduction.
