It has been shown that fibrinogen levels are the first to fall during PPH, and that a level inferior to a threshold of 2g/L is strongly associated with progression to severe PPH, hemostatic impairment, transfusion, and invasive hemostatic procedures.\n\nThe clinical diagnosis of coagulopathy is difficult, and the biological diagnosis by usual laboratory tests is often delayed, leading to the empirical administration of fibrinogen and blood products, sometimes unnecessary.\n\nThe TEG6S® is a viscoelastic testing device performed on whole blood, which allows a reliable assessment of hemostasis and coagulation quality in about ten minutes.\n\nThe anomalies detected by the TEG6S® allow for the early diagnosis of acquired coagulopathy, especially hypofibrinogenemia. Its use during the management of PPH would therefore allow for transfusion savings and potential economic benefits, in addition to improving patient prognosis through early and appropriate treatment (including the absence of early \"blind\" treatment in the absence of coagulopathy)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Postpartum
