However, there is no evidence in the existing scientific literature on the use of muscle tissue oximetry in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.\n\nThe primary objective of our study is to evaluate whether there is a correlation between average intraoperative muscle tissue oximetry below 65% (a value which is considered critical in the literature for the resulting cellular damage) and postoperative renal damage in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.","detailedDescription":"Tissue oximetry obtained from peripheral muscle can be used to measure the state of kidney's tissue oxygenation.\n\n50 Adult female patients ASA 1-2 undergoing cytoreductive surgery with laparoscopic or laparotomy technique (for ovarian cancer) associated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy will be enrolled.\n\nThe primary objective of our study is to evaluate whether there is a correlation between average intraoperative muscle tissue oximetry below 65% (a value which is considered critical in the literature for the resulting cellular damage) and postoperative renal damage (according to the AKIN and KIDGO classification) in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.\n\nSecondary objectives are:\n\n* describe the variation in muscle tissue oximetry and hemodynamic parameters (systolic, mean, diastolic blood pressure) during cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy .\n* describe the variation in renal function values (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) and serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloremia, calcemia) in the post-operative period (from the first to the seventh postoperative day)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oxygen Deficiency","Acute Kidney Injury","Ovarian Carcinoma"],"keywords":["Tissue Oximetry","Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy","Acute Kidney Injury","Hemodynamics parameters"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Tissue Oximetry with ForeSight","description":"Evaluation of a correlation between average intraoperative muscle tissue oximetry and postoperative renal damage in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC for ovarian cancer","otherNames":["Hemodynamics parameters with Hemosphere"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation between intraoperative tissue oximetry and postoperative acute renal injury.","description":"An intraoperative mean tissue oximetry value of 65% or less is considered to predict cellular damage.
