Treated lesions will be covered with opaque material (such as opaque clothing), followed 21 (±3) hours later by the administration of visible light. All of the participant's lesions that are readily available for exposure to the visible light source will be treated and 3 to 5 index lesions in each patient will be prospectively identified and documented for modified Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (mCAILS) evaluation. Participants will be followed every 4 weeks for a total of 12 weeks following their last light session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["CTCL/ Mycosis Fungoides","CTCL","Mycosis Fungoides","Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HyBryte (0.25% Hypericin)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"HyBryte gel is applied twice weekly for 18 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Hypericin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo gel is indistinguishable from HyBryte gel, and is applied twice weekly for 18 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Hypericin","description":"HyBryte gel (0.25% hypericin) is applied twice weekly for 18 weeks.
