The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is a tailored text messaging intervention feasible and acceptable among older adult patients with heart failure?\n* Does tailored text messaging improve self-care in adult patients with heart failure?\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups for 12 weeks: 1) intervention (text messaging); or 2) control group. Both groups will receive usual care, which includes regular follow-up visits at the heart failure clinic (standard care), plus a \"Discharge Packet for Patients Diagnosed with Heart Failure\", developed by the American Heart Association. Both groups will be asked via text messages and/or telephone calls to complete questionnaires at baseline/start, 4 weeks and 12 weeks, about self-care, quality of life, health beliefs, medications, diet, etc.\n\nParticipants assigned to the intervention group will also receive 5 text messages/week targeting medication adherence, heart-healthy diet, and daily HF symptoms monitoring for 12 weeks.","detailedDescription":"Heart failure (HF) is a serious chronic condition and the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Almost 7 million Americans are diagnosed with HF and new cases are rapidly rising at a rate of nearly 1 million per year. This feasibility pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted using individually tailored text message (TM) intervention, delivered to improve HF self-care adherence.\n\nThis randomized controlled trial in older adult patients (≥50 years of age) with HF to determine the feasibility (recruitment capability, acceptability), and preliminary efficacy of the Text4HF intervention compared with usual care over 12 weeks. Forty (n=40) patients from the University of Illinois Hospital \\& Health Sciences System (UIH) will be randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. Patients in the TM intervention (TEXT4HF) will receive messages that target the most common self-care factors known to precipitate HF hospitalizations (medication adherence, heart-healthy diet, and daily HF symptoms monitoring)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure"],"keywords":["Heart Failure","mHealth","Text Messaging","Mobile Phone"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TEXT4HF","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to usual care and a standard AHA information packet for patients with HF, participants in the intervention group will receive 5 tailored TMs/week for 12 weeks, targeting health beliefs about medication adherence, heart-healthy diet, self-monitoring of symptoms, and heart failure knowledge.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: TEXT4HF"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group will receive standard HF medical care, which includes nurse-led patient education about HF self-care before and/or after discharge as well as follow-up visits at the Outpatient Heart Failure Clinic at UIH post-hospital discharge and several times per year or more, depending on the severity of the patient's condition.
