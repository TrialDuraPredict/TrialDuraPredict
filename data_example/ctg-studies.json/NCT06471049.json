total hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed gynecological surgery.\n\nConventionally performed by a classical surgical approach, it is now provided routinely and for several years by laparoscopy and more recently by Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopy.\n\nA third minimally invasive option is currently being developed and proposed to avoid trans-peritoneal access, using a vaginal trans-laparoscopic technique, defined by the name V-NOTES (Vaginal-Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery).\n\nThese minimally invasive approaches have simplified this intervention on many surgical and anesthetic parameters (signing, surgical trauma, pain and post-operative ileus, recovery of autonomy) and consider possible management in the outpatient sector.\n\nThis study aims at enrolling women for which a total hysterectomy with or without annexectomy for the treatment of a benign pathology must be scheduled.\n\nThe objective of the study is to compare the success rate of outpatient treatment of the V-Notes route and the conventional laparoscopic route and to compare the success rate of outpatient treatment of the V-Notes route and the laparoscopic route assisted robot."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Surgery","Gynecologic
