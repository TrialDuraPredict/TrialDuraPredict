The women were randomly allocated to the intervention group and control group.\n\nMethod: Data collection took place at the outpatient clinic at the Assiut University in South Egypt Cancer Institute. The study involved a total of 100 participants diagnosed with breast cancer recruited using a purposive sampling method, who were categorized into two groups, each comprising 50 women. Group 1 received a psychoeducational program and relaxation training, while Group 2 received only routine care without the psychoeducational program. Inclusion criteria were age ranging from 20 to 60 years, consent to research participation, and nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosis. The investigators excluded failing to engage regularly in the psychoeducational program, suffering from a significant illness other than breast cancer, having a history of persistent psychological illnesses, and using psychiatric medications.","detailedDescription":"Breast cancer is the most frequent kind of cancer among women in developed as well as developing nations, and it is the leading malignancy among females in Egypt"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Women With Breast Cancer"],"keywords":["Self-esteem","Psychological Distress","Breast Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"a psychoeducational program and relaxation training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"a psychoeducational program and relaxation training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: psychoeducational"]},{"label":"routine care without the psychoeducational program","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"routine care without the psychoeducational program"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"psychoeducational","description":"educational program","armGroupLabels":["a psychoeducational program and relaxation training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurement tool: questionnaire The psychoeducational intervention employed was effective in enhancing resilience and self-esteem while changing psychological distress among women diagnosed with breast cancer","description":"The effect of psycho-educational program and relaxation training on resilience, self-esteem, and psychological distress among women with breast cancer","timeFrame":"5 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ranging from 20 to 60 years\n* Consent to research participation\n* Nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Failing to engage regularly in the psychoeducational programme\n* Suffering from a significant illness other than breast cancer\n* Having a history of persistent psychological illnesses\n* Using psychiatric medications.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","genderBased":true,"minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Saleh O Abdullah, prof","affiliation":"Assiut","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Faculty of Nursing","city":"Assiut","country":"Egypt","geoPoint":{"lat":27.18096,"lon":31.18368}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001943","term":"Breast Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000001941","term":"Breast Diseases"},{"id":"D000012871","term":"Skin Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M5220","name":"Breast Neoplasms","asFound":"Breast Cancer","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5218","name":"Breast Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15674","name":"Skin Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
