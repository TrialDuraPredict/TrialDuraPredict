Although the recent circumplex model provides a fine-grained picture of the different (de)motivating teaching styles (i.e., autonomy support, structure, control, and chaos) that physical education (PE) teachers can use in their lessons, no previous motivational training programs have been based on this model. Moreover, all SDT-training programs have been implemented through different group sessions, but individual sessions have not also been delivered.\n\nObjective: This study outlines the protocol of a motivational training program, derived from the circumplex model, designed to enhance (de)motivating teaching styles among PE teachers. Consequently, this program seeks to improve motivational variables and influence (mal)adaptive outcomes in both teachers and students.\n\nDesign: A randomized controlled trial design with a mixed-method approach. Participants: At least 16 secondary PE teachers will be assigned to either an experimental group or a control group, together with part of their students.\n\nIntervention: The training program comprises four face-to-face group sessions and two follow-up sessions (one individual and one group sessions). PE teachers will learn how to support autonomy and provide structure, as well as to be less controlling and chaotic towards students. Over a period of approximately five months, teachers will implement these motivational strategies during their PE classes.\n\nOutcome measures: Different (de)motivating teaching styles, motivational variables, and (mal)adaptive outcomes will be assessed in both PE teachers and their students at three distinct points: before the training program (T1), during the intervention (T2) and at the end of the intervention (T3). Additionally, two discussion groups involving all experimental PE teachers will be held (one following the training program and another at the end of the intervention).\n\nConclusion: The results from this study could be useful for developing motivational training programs for in-service PE teachers.","detailedDescription":"Physical Education (PE) teachers hold a pivotal role in guiding students through their learning process. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), teachers' (de)motivating style, referred to as \"the interpersonal sentiment and behaviour that teachers rely on during instruction to motivate students to engage in and benefit from learning activities\", is a crucial element in the teaching process. Recent research suggests that PE teachers employ a diverse array of teaching behaviours in their educational practice. Autonomy, competence, and relatedness-supportive teaching behaviours (i.e., need-supportive teaching behaviours) have been positively related to students' autonomous motivation and adaptive outcomes in PE, while the opposite is true for autonomy, competence, and relatedness-thwarting behaviours (i.e. need-thwarting behaviours). Consequently, continuous development teaching (CDT) programs, based on SDT, has increased in the last years. These SDT-training programs, mainly focused on autonomy-supportive strategies, revealed positive effects on students' perceptions of (de)motivating teaching behaviours and motivational outcomes. Over the past decade, SDT-training programs have also demonstrated positive effects on teachers' self-perceptions of certain antecedents, support for autonomy and structure, and various motivational and (mal)adaptive outcomes \\[6\\]. However, additional research is required, as most studies have not focused on reducing need-thwarting behaviours.\n\nRecently, grounded in SDT, the circumplex model offers a detailed view of the different (de)motivating teaching styles (i.e., autonomy support, structure, control, and chaos) that teachers can adopt in their classes. This circumplex model delineates eight teaching approaches across these four teaching styles. To develop the most effective interventions, it is crucial for researchers to understand the effectiveness of motivational training programs, not only in terms of the four (de)motivating teaching styles but also across the eight specific teaching approaches. Yet, no existing motivational training programs have incorporated this new circumplex approach. This mixed-method study sets out to expand existing knowledge by describing a protocol for a motivational training program based on the circumplex model, aimed at enhancing (de)motivating teaching styles, as well as (mal)adaptive outcomes among PE teachers and their students."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Teaching Program"],"keywords":["circumplex approach","teaching styles","self-determination theory","psychological needs."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The motivational process of teachers influences the way they teach PE lessons, which in turn will influence the motivational process of students.","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":900,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Physical Education Teachers (intervention)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"PE teachers who will receive the training.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Teaching training program"]},{"label":"Physical Education Teachers (non-intervention)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"PE teachers who will not receive the training."},{"label":"Students (intervention)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Students of those teachers who will received the training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Teaching training program"]},{"label":"Students (non-intervention)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Students of those teachers who will not received the training"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Teaching training program","description":"The investigators will try to carry out a training based on motivational strategies for physical education teachers of the experimental group, with the aim of improving their motivational teaching style during physical education classes, and finally, to obtain benefits in their students, such as a greater adherence to physical activity.","armGroupLabels":["Physical Education Teachers (intervention)","Students (intervention)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quantitative measures: (De)motivating teaching styles and approaches towards students","description":"To assess self-reported (de)motivating teaching styles toward students, the Spanish version of the SIS in Physical Education (SIS-PE) will be used.
