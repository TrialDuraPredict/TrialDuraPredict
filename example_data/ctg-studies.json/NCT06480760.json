Previous studies with heart failure patients had shown that carnosine supplementation increases walking capacity in these patients.","detailedDescription":"The objectives of this double-blinded longitudinal study are to determine whether carnosine supplementation (1 g) for 6 months in subjects with non-claudication and claudication peripheral arterial disease (PAD) improves walking ability. In this pilot study there will be enrolled 120 subjects that will be divided into placebo (n=60) and carnosine groups (n=60). The distance covered on the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) and the pain free walking capacity on the treadmill before and after the placebo or carnosine supplementation will be measured. Ankle branchial index (ABI), blood flow by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) before and after the carnosine and placebo supplementation will be also measured. In addition, the carnosine will be measured by 1HMRS, global metabolomics and proteomics in the skeletal muscle will be performed, a comprehensive lipid and metabolic panels of blood will be performed, uptake of carnosine in red blood cells (RBCs) will be measured, and carnosine aldehyde conjugates in the urine before and after 6 months of carnosine and placebo supplementation will be evaluated. Following completion of the study, the subjects will be followed up for another 3 months and examine the durability of carnosine supplementation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Peripheral Arterial Disease"],"keywords":["peripheral arterial disease","carnosine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"A randomized, double-blinded longitudinal study in approximately 120 PAD patients","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Cellulose"},{"label":"Carnosine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Carnosine 1 g daily for 6 months","interventionNames":["Drug: Carnosine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carnosine","description":"Food ingredient (supplement)","armGroupLabels":["Carnosine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measure distance covered on six-minute walk tes","description":"Distance covered on a flat and hard surface in 6 minutes.
