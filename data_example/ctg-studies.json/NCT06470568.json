Participants will be identified with MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ). They will be randomly assigned to two equal groups: a control group (receiving usual therapy) and an intervention group (receiving usual therapy plus resistance training). Participants in the control group will receive usual care for 12 weeks, including one medical review and one educational talk. Participants in the intervention group will maintain their usual therapy and will participate in supervised full-body resistance training with a kinesiologist, performing exercises three times per week for 12 weeks. All participants in both groups will be evaluated before (Pre-time 0) and after (Post-time 1) the intervention. During the evaluations, samples and measurements will be taken, including fasting blood samples for BDNF and CTSB measurement, whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to assess global muscle mass, and magnetic resonance imaging of the quadriceps and brain.

Finally, quality of life will be assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF scale. Expected Results: Few studies worldwide, and none in Chile, have evaluated the effects of resistance training on cognitive function, muscle mass, and strength gain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, or the correlation between increased muscle strength and cognition. There are also no protocols or clinical guidelines for resistance training in this at-risk population. The impact of resistance exercise on cognitive function in individuals with MCI remains unclear. The proposed research will provide new insights into the effectiveness of resistance training on cognition in individuals with MCI over 60 years of age. We hope that our findings will be of significant value in the development of future interventions to prevent or postpone the progression of dementia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mild Cognitive Impairment"],"keywords":["Mild cognitive impairment","Resistance exercise training","Cognition","Dementia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"The kinesiologists performing the assessments will be blind to the intervention.

Upper body exercises will then be conducted on the chest press, pull-up, and horizontal rowing machines, with each exercise comprising 2 sets.\n\nTo conclude each session, there will be a 5-minute cooldown period involving global muscle stretching exercises. During the initial 6-week period, the workload will progressively increase from 60% to 80% of 1RM (10 repetitions per set). Subsequently, the 1RM will be reassessed to adjust workloads (maintaining 60%-80%) for the subsequent 6-week period.

This examination is sensitive to cognitive changes in the early stages of cognitive impairment (Slachevsky et al., 2014; Mat√≠as-Guiu et al., 2018). The questionnaire, adapted and validated for the Chilean population (Bruno et al., 2020), showed a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 82%. It is composed of five domains: attention, memory, language, verbal fluency, and visuospatial skills, and takes no more than 20 minutes to complete. The result is based on a maximum score of 100 points, where higher scores indicate better memory and cognitive performance.","timeFrame":"The assessment will be conducted before and after the 12-week intervention"},{"measure":"Change in body composition measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning after resistance exercise training","description":"Whole-body and regional lean mass and whole-body fat mass were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning (Lunar General Electric iDEXA, General Electric Medical Systems).
