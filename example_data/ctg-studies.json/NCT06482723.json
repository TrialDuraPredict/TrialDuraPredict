It was intended to be used as a temporary filler to correct small skin defects, such as wrinkles or scars. In particular, it was recommended for the treatment of wrinkles around the lip.\n\nmGlobal L+AS for the facial area is a sterile, injectable, gel colourless, transparent, non-pyrogenic, reabsorbable product containing cross-linked hyaluronic acid of non-animal origin, produced via bacterial fermentation.\n\nThis clinical investigation was conducted as an uncontrolled - no comparator was used. The safety and performance of the treatment were evaluated by comparison of the condition with the state of the treated area before initiation of the procedure, conducted by the trained Principal Investigator.\n\nThe investigated product mGlobal L+AS was applied by intradermal or subcutaneous injection by the investigator during Session 1 for all subjects and Session 2 for the subjects, for whom a touch-up was considered beneficial. Both sessions were conducted within 14-day intervals.\n\nThe evaluation process during the medical examination was facilitated by photographic evidence taken before and after therapy at predetermined time points for reference."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Skin Aging","Skin Wrinkling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single Group Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mGlobal L+AS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The investigated product mGlobal L+AS was applied by intradermal or subcutaneous injection by the investigator during Session 1 for all subjects and Session 2 for the subjects, for whom a touch-up was considered beneficial.
