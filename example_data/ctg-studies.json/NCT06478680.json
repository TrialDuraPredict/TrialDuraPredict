Investigators want to compare improvements in your walking function and mental health that occur after 20 interventions. The study also aims to evaluate if participants' mental health, social support, and health literacy affect attendance at physical therapy sessions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Gait, Hemiplegic"],"keywords":["health literacy","balance","compliance to therapy","gait function","high intensity gait training","exoskeleton"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High intensity gait training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"One session of conventional neurorehabilitation intervention per week One session of Forward Walking with EksoGT per week","interventionNames":["Behavioral: High intensity gait training"]},{"label":"Exoskeleton mediated gait training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Two sessions of High-Intensity Gait Training","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Exoskeleton mediated gait training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Exoskeleton mediated gait training","description":"1 session of Forward Walking with EksoGT per week\n\n1 session of conventional neurorehabilitation intervention per week\n\n* Transfer training\n* Gait training\n* Balance (sitting/standing; static/dynamic)\n* Strength\n* Neuromuscular re-education\n* Orthotics\n* Positioning\n* Caregiver education\n* Assistive device\n* Wheelchair assessment and mobility\n* Endurance training","armGroupLabels":["Exoskeleton mediated gait training"],"otherNames":["EksoGT-mediated gait training"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"High intensity gait training","description":"2 sessions of High-Intensity Gait Training at a target heart rate of 60-80% of the maximum heart rate or target RPE of 15-18\n\n* Forward stepping practice\n* Backwards stepping practices\n* Sidestepping\n* Stairs\n* Balance and compliant surface training while walking\n* Propulsion\n* Lateral balance training\n* Stability training\n* Stance control training\n* Limb advancement","armGroupLabels":["High intensity gait training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Demographic Questionnaire","description":"Questions include age, sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, total income during T the past 12 months, main occupation and when was the last work, language at home, marital status, education level, and if they take any antidepressants.","timeFrame":"Pre-intervention"},{"measure":"Newest Vital Sign (NVS)","description":"The NVS is a 6-question screening tool that identifies participants' risk of low or limited health literacy (HL) based on interpreting an ice cream nutrition label.","timeFrame":"Pre-intervention"},{"measure":"Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)","description":"The MSPSS is a 12-item self-administered scale that measures social support.","timeFrame":"Pre-intervention"},{"measure":"Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)","description":"The PHQ-9 is a self-administered depression screening tool with nine items.
