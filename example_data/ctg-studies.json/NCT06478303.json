An illustrative example is the interaction between language comprehension and motor representations. For instance, motor training (e.g., sports, origami training) can facilitate action verb recognition, whereas motor deficits (e.g., upper limb immobilization) can hinder the processing of action language. Similarly, action language has been shown to affect motor performance. These effects are attributed to an implicit form of motor imagery, an automatic simulation of motor experience (without actual movement) evoked by action words. Interestingly, literature supports the idea that the motor simulations used for imagining an action are also engaged during the reading of action language, leading to similar neurophysiological and behavioral changes in both processes. However, questions remain about the similarity of the simulations generated by motor imagery and action language. This project, encompassing three experimental sequences, aims to address these questions to achieve significant scientific advancements in both theoretical and applied domains."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Corticospinal Excitability","Cortical Activation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TMS Experimental group","interventionNames":["Other: Motor imagery","Other: Action reading"]},{"label":"fMRI Experimental group","interventionNames":["Other: Motor imagery","Other: Action reading","Other: Motor localizer"]},{"label":"Experimental ccPAS group","interventionNames":["Other: Motor imagery","Other: Action reading"]},{"label":"Sham ccPAS group","interventionNames":["Other: Motor imagery","Other: Action reading"]},{"label":"control group","interventionNames":["Other: Motor imagery","Other: Action reading"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor imagery","description":"Participants were asked to imagine arm or foot movements.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental ccPAS group","Sham ccPAS group","TMS Experimental group","control group","fMRI Experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Action reading","description":"Participants were asked to read sentences involving arm or foot movements","armGroupLabels":["Experimental ccPAS group","Sham ccPAS group","TMS Experimental group","control group","fMRI Experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Motor localizer","description":"Participants were asked to perform arm or foot movements","armGroupLabels":["fMRI Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Level of corticospinal excitability","description":"this is a physiological response obtained by transcranial magnetic pulses (TMS).
