Twenty fasted subjects will undergo a baseline health assessment via a questionnaire, baseline clinical chemistries, blood lipids, dexa and impedence testing (to identify bone mineral density and body muscle/fat/water composition), and metabolite/novel biomarker testing through whole capillary blood, saliva, and urine collections. Assessments will be repeated every month (3 times after initial assessment) to cover a 3 month period. All measurements from each visit will be compared with baseline using paired t-tests or Chi square testing depending on variable. Power analyses are not included due to the pilot nature of the study. This pilot study will provide the necessary variability estimates for future trials.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to explore potential positive human health effects of a proprietary nutraceutical formulation known as M4C. The impetus for M4C came from Dr. McGraw's attempt to alleviate the chronic inflammation a family member was experiencing through a non-invasive, natural, nutraceutical approach. Anecdotal findings of M4C show an antiinflammatory effect (observed in the presence of inflammatory conditions and after traumatic injury such as a sprain or fall), improved metabolic, gastrointestinal, and mental health, as well as enhanced exercise response and recovery. In this study the investigators will examine whether supplementation with M4C is associated with any changes in lipids, clinical chemistries, body composition, questionnaire covariates, metabolites/novel suspected lipopeptides, hemoglobin A1C, or bone mineral density."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["General Health and Wellness","Energy and Vitality","Cognitive Function and Mental Health","Weight Management","Digestive Health","Exercise Tolerance","Cardiovascular Health","Bone and Joint Health","Skin, Hair, and Nail Health","Immune Support","Sports Performance and Recovery","Sleep and Relaxation","Obesity","Anti Inflammatory"],"keywords":["General Health and Wellness","Energy and Vitality","Cognitive Function and Mental Health","Weight Management","Digestive Health","Exercise Tolerance","Cardiovascular Health","Bone and Joint Health","Skin, Hair, and Nail Health","Immune Support","Sports Performance and Recovery","Sleep and relaxation","Obesity","anti inflammatory"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open label single arm intervention pilot","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"M4C Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single arm study with nutraceutical M4C treatment.
