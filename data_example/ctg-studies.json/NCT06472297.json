The goal is to prevent transition to type 2 diabetes.","detailedDescription":"Video narratives will be provided by Latino community health workers, known as Promotores de Salud (PdS), who will wear and experience the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and its glycemic variability feedback. In Study 1 (G1), we will conduct a Phase 0 intervention development study, enrolling a sample of 20 Spanish- and/or English-speaking PdS who test positive for pre-diabetes via a finger prick screening. Participants will wear CGM devices for 20 days, during which they will record daily narratives about their experiences with the CGM feedback and their glucose variability. Structured interviews between staff and participants will explore the benefits and barriers of CGM use. These recorded video clips will serve as the foundation for educational cinematic smartphone videos for future interventions. We will then use artificial intelligence tools to translate the text, audio, and video clips into various languages for broad dissemination. Blood glucose levels in mg/dL will be recorded continuously over the wear period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pre-diabetes"],"keywords":["Pre-diabetes","Glucose management","Feedback","Narrative education","Artificial intelligence","Contingency-shaped learning"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"A case series of participants wear an unmasked CGM sensor for a condition lasting 20 days while recording daily narratives of their experience.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The CGM system feedback is unmasked.
