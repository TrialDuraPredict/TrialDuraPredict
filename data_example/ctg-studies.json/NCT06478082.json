VR games are controlled unimanually or bimanually. When unimanually-controlled games are performed with the affected upper limb, movements of the unaffected hand are completely ineffective. This mimics the principle of forced use. To some degree, also bimanually-controlled games result in a forced use of the affected upper limb.\n\nAdditionally, VR could help in the engagement in rehabilitation programs, as virtual environments and gaming increases enjoyment and motivation, and therefore therapy adherence. Accordingly, VR-based gaming may have the potential to improve upper limb functionality in children with CP.\n\nObjective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a home-based VR intervention to improve upper limb functionality in children with CP. Sub-objective: The validation of a self-developed upper limb assessment (Upper Limb Reaching Test).\n\nStudy population: Children and adolescents with unilateral CP (age 10-18 years old). Intervention: The intervention consists of VR-based rehabilitation with the Oculus Quest device. The training frequency and duration represents 2x15 minutes a day, five days a week, for a total of eight weeks. Therefore, this rehabilitation intervention should represent a total amount of 20 hours of rehabilitation. However, the total dosage is variable as the intervention is self-managed.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Logbook, System Usability Scale, Melbourne Assessment 2, Wall Arm Reaching Test, Elbow and shoulder range of motion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cerebral Palsy"],"keywords":["Home-based rehabilitation","Virtual Reality","Upper limb"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Children with unilateral Cerebral Palsy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All children have unilateral cerebral palsy and are between 1-18 years old","interventionNames":["Device: Home-based virtual reality training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Home-based virtual reality training","description":"8-week training with an advised frequency of 30 minutes per day, for 5 days per week.","armGroupLabels":["Children with unilateral Cerebral Palsy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Logbook","description":"Participants keep a logbook in which they log the date of training, games played, duration of activity and enjoyment of game","timeFrame":"During the 8-week intervention period"},{"measure":"System Usability Scale","description":"This questionnaire consists of 10 items regarding the usability of the virtual reality training.
