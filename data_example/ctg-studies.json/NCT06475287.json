The overall situation is still unsatisfactory, with low objective tumor response rates and targeted immune resistance being the main reasons affecting treatment efficacy. Increasing local treatment or overcoming resistance is currently a hot research topic. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of HAIC combined with TQB2450 and anlotinib for second-line treatment of advanced HCC patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hepatocellular Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HAIC combined with TQB2450 and Anlotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: HAIC（Mitoxantrone+Raltitrexed）、anlotinib、TQB2450"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"HAIC（Mitoxantrone+Raltitrexed）、anlotinib、TQB2450","description":"The combination therapy of HAIC with TQB2450 and Anlotinib was administered to enrolled patients in no particular order.

Systemic treatment was given every 21 days, with a fixed dose of 1200mg of TQB2450 injection on the first day of each systemic treatment cycle (1-7 days after HAIC treatment), administered intravenously over 60 minutes initially, followed by 30 minutes if tolerated. Anlotinib was administered orally once daily at a dose of 10mg, with a two-week break every three weeks.
