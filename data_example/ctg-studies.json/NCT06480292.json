It is a common metabolic disease that can lead to health risks for the mother, fetus, and child, and can negatively impact the mother's quality of life. This study aims to explore how a telerehabilitation exercise program affects the quality of life of mothers with GDM and the health of fetus/neonate.","detailedDescription":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) significantly impacts maternal quality of life (QoL) and fetal/neonatal health. According to the World Health Organization, quality of life (QOL) is a person's view of their status in life within their culture and value system. Pregnancies with GDM, negatively affect personal, familial, and social life, leading to poorer QOL. GDM causes medical issues for the mother and fetus and harms the mother's psychological well-being, reducing her QOL. Due to the increasing prevalence of GDM and the importance of improving QOL for affected women, this study examines impact of telerehabilitation exercise on quality of life of pregnant women. Awareness about the importance of exercise in managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is crucial. Regular physical activity can help control blood sugar levels, reduce insulin resistance, and improve overall health for both the mother and fetus leading to better pregnancy outcomes.Telerehabilitation offers convenience, accessibility, and personalized support, allowing patients to exercise from home with continuous healthcare provider monitoring.It is a cost-effective, flexible, and safer alternative to traditional exercise methods, especially beneficial for managing gestational diabetes.\n\nThe control group will recieve routine medical care and the experimental group will recieve structured telerehabilitation exercise protocol. The results of both groups will be recorded and compared to assess the effectiveness of using telerehabilitation in the treatment of women with GDM in improving their quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This will be a comparison between two groups; experimental and control group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telerehabilitation exercise program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive a structured tele rehabilitation exercise protocol of low to moderate intensity warm up ,aerobic ,resistance and cool down exercises for 3 times a week progressively increased for 8 weeks. along with routine medical care will be provided.","interventionNames":["Other: telerehabilitation exercise"]},{"label":"Routine medical care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will receive routine medical care including oral medication (metformin), dietry precautions and advised to do regular walk for 20-30minutes.","interventionNames":["Other: routine medical care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"telerehabilitation exercise","description":"5 min warmup will include ankle plantar and dorsiflexion ,trunk side flexion ,shoulder circles ,shoulder ROMS.it will be followed by 5 min aerobics that includes spot marching and side stepping. it will be followed by resistance exercise which will be divided into 3 groups. each group of exercise will be performed one day each. chair squats, arm pulls, seated triceps, biceps curls etc. are included in these resistance exercises. intensity of each exercise will be progressively increased.","armGroupLabels":["Telerehabilitation exercise program"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"routine medical care","description":"The control group will be given routine medical care (including dietary modification, oral anti diabetics (metformin) and advised to do regular walk (20-30min/day).","armGroupLabels":["Routine medical care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"GDMQ-36 for Maternal Quality of Life","description":"The GDMQ (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Quality of Life)-36 is a simple, valid, and reliable tool for assessing the quality of life of women with GDM across five domains: Emotional, Physical, Social, Self-Efficacy, and Healthcare. Each domain includes multiple items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) with a score range of 1 to 5. Domain scores are calculated by summing the responses for each item, and the total GDMQ score is the sum of all domain scores. Higher scores generally indicate better quality of life if the scale is positively oriented. This tool helps identify areas needing intervention and support, offering a comprehensive measure of GDM-related quality of life.","timeFrame":"changes from baseline to 8th week"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fetal Health","description":"Fetal Health measured by fetal obstetric ultrasound and anomaly scan.","timeFrame":"changes from baseline to 8th week"},{"measure":"Neonatal Health","description":"Neonatal outcome measured by examination and pediatric records.","timeFrame":"At the time of delivery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women aged 20 to 35 years\n* Gestational age between 20-28weeks\n* diagnosed with Gestational diabetes mellitus through oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n* Primigravida and multigravida\n* able to do 6 6-minute walk tests under a severity level of 6 on the Borg scale of breathlessness.\n* Patients or caregivers have and able to use an electronic device (PC, tablet or smartphone)\n* Who signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previously diagnosed T1DM or T2DM\n* High-risk pregnancy conditions contraindicating exercise as per ACOG guidelines\n* Patients taking insulin regularly.\n* Patients with fetal anomalies diagnosed at 20 th week.\n* Multiple gestation (twin or triplets).","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"35 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Huma Riaz, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"03215242874","email":"huma.riaz@riphah.edu.pk"},{"name":"Ghazal Fatima, MSPT-WHPT*","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+92 333 6643305"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Huma Riaz, PhD","affiliation":"Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Pakistan Railways Hospital","city":"Rawalpindi","state":"Punjab","zip":"44000","country":"Pakistan","contacts":[{"name":"Ghazal Fatima, MSPT (WHPT)*","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+92 333 6643305"},{"name":"Beenish khurram, FCPS","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Aisha Razzaq, PHD* Rehab","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Kanwal Khan, MSPT","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.6007,"lon":73.0679}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000016640","term":"Diabetes, Gestational"},{"id":"D000011254","term":"Pregnancy in Diabetics"},{"id":"D000003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"},{"id":"D000011248","term":"Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7115","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19012","name":"Diabetes, Gestational","asFound":"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M14133","name":"Pregnancy in Diabetics","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11639","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25403","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7862","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14127","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2875","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27093","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8399","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","asFound":"Quality of Life","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M11667","name":"Metformin","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10054","name":"Hypoglycemic Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Hypo","name":"Hypoglycemic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
