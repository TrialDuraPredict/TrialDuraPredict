The patient has been diagnosed with PD at least 5 years ago.\n2. The patient has inadequate response to existing drug treatments.\n3. The patient is ≥ 40 years and \\< 70 years of age at the time of informed consent.\n4. The patient is in stage 2.5 or higher on the Hoehn and Yahr scale at OFF time.\n5. The patient is in stage 3 or lower on the Hoehn and Yahr scale at ON time.\n6. The patient has a L-dopa response of 30% or more.\n7. The subject provides written informed consent to participate in the study. If the subject cannot sign due to physical constraints, verbal consent may be provided with signature of a Legally Authorized Representative.\n8. The subject is willing to avoid pregnancy using abstinence, highly effective means of birth control, surgical sterility, or menopause.\n9. The subject does not have dyskinesia.\n10. The subject is willing to comply with the protocol-required assessments.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\ni. The presence of any of these features rules out PD. ii. Unequivocal cerebellar abnormalities, such as cerebellar gait, limb ataxia, or cerebellar oculomotor abnormalities iii. Downward vertical supranuclear gaze palsy or selective slowing of downward vertical saccades iv. Diagnosis of probable behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, deﬁned according to the MDS criteria (consensus criteria), within the ﬁrst 5 years of disease v. Parkinsonian features restricted to the lower limbs for more than 3 years. vi. Treatment with a dopamine receptor blocker or a dopamine-depleting agent in a dose and time-course consistent with drug-induced parkinsonism vii. Absence of observable response to high-dose levodopa despite at least moderate severity of disease viii. Unequivocal cortical sensory loss (i.e., graphesthesia, stereognosis with intact primary sensory modalities), clear limb ideomotor apraxia, or progressive aphasia ix. Normal functional neuroimaging of the presynaptic dopaminergic system x. Documentation of an alternative condition known to produce parkinsonism and plausibly connected to the subject's symptoms, or the expert evaluating physician, based on the full diagnostic assessment, feels that an alternative syndrome is more likely than PD\n\n-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Maria Huaracha","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(858) 5349700","email":"mhuaracha@health.ucsd.edu"},{"name":"Donna Brusch","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(760) 505-6649","email":"dbrusch@health.ucsd.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Joseph Ciacci, MD","affiliation":"University of California, San Diego","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of California, San Diego","status":"RECRUITING","city":"La Jolla","state":"California","zip":"92037","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Christian P Fulinara","role":"CONTACT","phone":"858-249-3038","email":"chfulinara@health.ucsd.edu"},{"name":"Donna Brusch","role":"CONTACT","phone":"760-505-6649","email":"dbrusch@health.ucsd.edu"},{"name":"Joseph Ciacci, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Sharona Ben-Haim, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Stephanie Lessig, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Forseth Kiefer, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Marsala Martin, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.84727,"lon":-117.2742}}]},"referencesModule":{"seeAlsoLinks":[{"label":"Parkinson's disease and related disorders (3) Parkinson's disease","url":"http://www.nanbyou.or.jp/entry/314"},{"label":"Pre-clinical study of induced pluripotent stem cell- derived dopaminergic progenitor cells for Parkinson's Disease","url":"http://www.neurology-jp.org/guidelinem/parkinson.html"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010300","term":"Parkinson Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000020734","term":"Parkinsonian Disorders"},{"id":"D000001480","term":"Basal Ganglia Diseases"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009069","term":"Movement Disorders"},{"id":"D000080874","term":"Synucleinopathies"},{"id":"D000019636","term":"Neurodegenerative Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13213","name":"Parkinson Disease","asFound":"Parkinson's Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M22574","name":"Dyskinesias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4565","name":"Ataxia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5773","name":"Cerebellar Ataxia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22494","name":"Parkinsonian Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25603","name":"Ganglion Cysts","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16358","name":"Synovial Cyst","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4774","name":"Basal Ganglia Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5204","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5742","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12029","name":"Movement Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2217","name":"Synucleinopathies","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21558","name":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000004298","term":"Dopamine"},{"id":"D000018491","term":"Dopamine Agonists"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002316","term":"Cardiotonic Agents"},{"id":"D000013566","term":"Sympathomimetics"},{"id":"D000001337","term":"Autonomic Agents"},{"id":"D000018373","term":"Peripheral Nervous System Agents"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"},{"id":"D000015259","term":"Dopamine Agents"},{"id":"D000018377","term":"Neurotransmitter Agents"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"},{"id":"D000020011","term":"Protective Agents"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7473","name":"Dopamine","asFound":"Indium","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20595","name":"Dopamine Agonists","asFound":"Indium","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M21258","name":"Radiopharmaceuticals","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5572","name":"Cardiotonic Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16345","name":"Sympathomimetics","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17962","name":"Dopamine Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20504","name":"Neurotransmitter Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21869","name":"Protective Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CaAg","name":"Cardiotonic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
