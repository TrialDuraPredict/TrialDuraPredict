It measures 90 x 69 x 92 mm. Upon application of contrast medium, the hypodense parts present enhancement up to 44 HU. (Fig. 1, 2). She was decided for surgical resection of the tumor via laparoscopic transabdominal approach. The surgery went well without any intraoperative and postoperative complications. She was discharged after day 3."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Adrenal Myelolipoma"],"keywords":["Benign, neoplasms, adrenal myelolipoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"laparoscopic adrenalectomy","description":"laparoscopic transabdominal approach."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cure of the disease","description":"Complete myelolipoma resection","timeFrame":"3 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient with myelolipoma\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient without myelolipoma","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"48 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"48 Year old Female","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Mexican Institute Of Social Health","city":"Mérida","state":"Yucatán","zip":"92227","country":"Mexico","geoPoint":{"lat":20.97537,"lon":-89.61696}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"manuscript publication","infoTypes":["CSR"],"timeFrame":"July 2024 for ever"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000018209","term":"Myelolipoma"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000018205","term":"Neoplasms, Adipose Tissue"},{"id":"D000018204","term":"Neoplasms, Connective and Soft Tissue"},{"id":"D000009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M20355","name":"Myelolipoma","asFound":"Myelolipoma","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20351","name":"Neoplasms, Adipose Tissue","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20350","name":"Neoplasms, Connective and Soft Tissue","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12315","name":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7992","name":"Epinephrine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M30371","name":"Racepinephrine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M211043","name":"Epinephryl borate","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"VaCoAg","name":"Vasoconstrictor Agents"},{"abbrev":"Resp","name":"Respiratory System Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
