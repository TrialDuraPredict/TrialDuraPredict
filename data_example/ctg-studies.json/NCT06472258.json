However, the efficacy of this single drug as compared to the combined drug regimen remained questionable, and the clinical response was considered delayed or inappropriate. Therefore, this research intended to evaluate the efficacy of only IV artesunate versus IV artesunate plus IV quinine in the treatment of severe malaria in children. The findings of the study would be helpful knowing whether the two drugs, when given together, have considerable benefit over single-drug therapy when given for the same."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malaria"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":104,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"IV Artesunate Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"IV Artesunate with weight appropriate dosage on 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours, and continued 12 hourly for a maximum duration of seven days.
