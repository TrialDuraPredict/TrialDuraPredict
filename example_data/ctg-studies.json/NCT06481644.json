The specific aims are to describe the clinical profile and outcomes of all admissions to Asian pediatric ICUs, determine the risk factors associated with poor outcomes, determine quality indicators for benchmarking ICU performance across sites and develop and train artificial intelligence algorithms to predict mortality, length of ICU stay and resource utilization.","detailedDescription":"Critical illness is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The mortality rate in pediatric ICUs globally may vary from 2% in high resource settings to a 28% in low resource settings. This variable mortality outcome is due to several factors. There are differing patient populations (e.g. medical, surgical, oncology) who get admitted to the ICU and at different severity thresholds. Patients in the region are ethnically and genetically diverse. And lastly, ICU management itself is variable and dependent on expertise and resources. This study will adopt a multicentered prospective observational design. Data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, ICU therapies, ICU quality indicators and outcomes will be recorded prospectively. Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics, multivariable analysis, area under the receiver operating curve analysis and a variety of machine learning algorithms to achieve its aims."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pediatrics","Intensive Care Unit","Critical Illness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood, deep tracheal lavage, bronchoalveoalr lavage, respiratory and oropharyngeal swabs, surface swabs, stools."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pediatric critical illness","description":"All admissions to the pediatric ICU of participant hospitals without restriction to age, gender or race/ethnicity.
