Recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma that has failed first-line platinum-containing standard regimen and/or second-line standard regimen failure.\n6. Previously received at least one line of systemic therapy. (Progression after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy, during neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, or within 6 months after the end of treatment can be recorded as 1-line therapy).\n7. Recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma that has failed anti PD-1/L1: anti PD-1/L1 exposure at least 6 weeks, and the protocol used at the time of enrollment in this study meets one of the following two points: (1) Relapse during adjuvant therapy after radiotherapy, or relapse within 6 months after the end of treatment; (2) First-line treatment phase, progression during anti PD-1/L1 treatment, or progression within 3 months after the end of anti PD-1/L1 (whether combined with chemotherapy/targeting drugs);\n8. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (the spiral CT scan diameter of the measurable lesion is ≥ 10 mm or the short diameter of the enlarged lymph node is ≥15mm ); lesions that have undergone local treatment can be selected as target lesions if there is clear evidence of significant progress compared to the end of treatment.\n9. All acute toxicities of previous antitumor therapy have returned to ≤ grade 1 (according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0) or reached the level specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
