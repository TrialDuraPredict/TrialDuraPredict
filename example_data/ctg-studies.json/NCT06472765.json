Specifically, the research aims to investigate how imbalances in microbial communities, such as the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria or the depletion of beneficial ones, are linked to conditions like Bacterial Vaginosis, Candidiasis, Urinary Tract Infections, Vaginal Atrophy, and others. By employing PCR testing and the outcomes of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the microbiome, the study seeks to identify distinct microbial profiles and patterns that are characteristic of each condition. This nuanced understanding is expected to lead to more accurate and early diagnosis, facilitating personalized and effective treatment strategies that go beyond the conventional, often indiscriminate use of antibiotics.","detailedDescription":"This study protocol is developed to analyze the vaginal microbiome of women using a 56-panel PCR test and NGS test. The aim is to collect vaginal swab samples from a wide range of participants, including both healthy individuals and those with diagnosed gynecological conditions, to identify different microbiome profiles.\n\nA key aspect of this study is the creation of a registry that will compile the data obtained from the PCR/NGS test results and participant information. This registry will serve as a valuable resource for ongoing research and will support the development of personalized approaches in women's health care. By systematically collecting and analyzing data, the registry will facilitate a better understanding of the vaginal microbiome's role in health and disease, aiding in the advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.\n\nAdditionally, the registry will provide a foundation for future studies, allowing for the exploration of long-term trends and relationships within the vaginal microbiome. This could lead to new insights into how the microbiome influences gynecological health and the development of targeted treatments. The combination of validating a precise diagnostic tool and establishing a comprehensive registry is aimed at enhancing patient care and supporting the broader research community in women's health."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bacterial Vaginosis","Candidiasis","Urinary Tract Infections","Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause","Lichen Sclerosus","Lichen Planus","Vulvodynia","Endometriosis","Ureaplasma Infections","Cancer","Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Vaginal swab for Next Generation Sequencing and Polymerase Chain Reaction tests."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Premenopausal Healthy","description":"Premenopausal Healthy"},{"label":"Perimenopausal Healthy","description":"Perimenopausal Healthy"},{"label":"Postmenopausal Healthy","description":"Postmenopausal Healthy"},{"label":"Bacterial Vaginosis","description":"Bacterial Vaginosis"},{"label":"Candidiasis","description":"Yeast Infections"},{"label":"Urinary Tract Infection","description":"Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women"},{"label":"Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause","description":"Vaginal Atrophy"},{"label":"Lichen Sclerosus/Planus","description":"Lichen Sclerosus/Planus"},{"label":"Vulvodynia","description":"Vulvodynia"},{"label":"Endometriosis","description":"Endometriosis"},{"label":"Ureaplasma","description":"Ureaplasma"},{"label":"Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis (DIV)","description":"Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis (DIV)"},{"label":"Cancer","description":"Group 1: Breast cancer patients diagnosed at stages 1-3, post-menopausal (due to surgical, chemical reasons, or age-related natural processes), and currently receiving anti-estrogen treatment for a minimum of 90 days.\n\nGroup 2: Breast cancer patients diagnosed at stages 1-3, pre-menopausal, and undergoing anti-estrogen endocrine therapy for at least 90 days.\n\nGroup 3: Participants diagnosed with any type of cancer at stages 1-3, not receiving anti-estrogen therapy, but have been using vaginal estrogen, prasterone, or DHEA for 90 days or more.
