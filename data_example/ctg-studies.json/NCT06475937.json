DM001 is an experimental drug which is not approved by health authorities for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.\n\nParticipants will have up to 17 visits during the study.There will be up to a 4-week Screening Period followed by a treatment period that will be divided into 3-week cycles/ Participants will have 5 study visits during Cycle 1, 3 visits during Cycles 2 and 3, and 1 visit during subsequent cycles. Participants will have an End of Treatment visit 21 days (+ 7 days) after last dose of study drug and then a follow-up visit 30 days (± 7 days) after the End of Treatment visit.","detailedDescription":"This is a Phase 1, multicenter, openlabel, first-in-human (FIH), doseescalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of DM001 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.\n\nDM001, a bispecific ADC developed using fully human antibodies with a common light chain, which targets TROP2 and EGFR.\n\nDM001 is sterile yellowish-green lyophilized powder for IV infusion.\n\nSubjects with solid malignant tumors will be treated with DM001 on Day 1 once Q3W (dose adjustments may be required depending on the safety profile and PK data of each dose)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Neoplasms","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","Solid Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"DM001 administrated to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An IV infusion of DM001 will be administrated approximately 30-60 min on Day 1 once Q3W","interventionNames":["Drug: DM001"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"DM001","description":"Subjects may continue to receive DM001 (with an increased dose that has been assessed as safe in the dose-escalation period) once every 3 weeks (Q3W) for a total of 6 cycles at the discretion of the investigators, until unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease (PD), or withdrawal of consent.","armGroupLabels":["DM001 administrated to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of DM001","description":"Incidence of DLTs of DM001 will be determined.
