The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n* Is the bioceramic cements promote faster healing due to their better sealing capacity and high bio-compatibility?\n* Are there no differences between cements in terms of apical repair? If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare Bio-C Sealer (Bioceramic sealer) Zinc-oxide eugenol sealer and AH-Plus epoxy resin sealer to see if periapical healing after six months of conventional endodontic therapy.\n\nParticipants will permanent restoration must be performed no later than 15 days after endodontic therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Apical Periodontitis"],"keywords":["Clinical Trial","Endodontic Sealer","Periapical healing"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Groupe 1: ZOE-based sealant","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"ZOE-based sealant (GROSS-MAN, PROQUIDENT, COL)","interventionNames":["Drug: Zinc-Oxide Eugenol Sealer"]},{"label":"Groupe 2: AH-Plus Epoxy Resin Sealer","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Epoxy resin-based sealant (AH Plus, Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany)","interventionNames":["Drug: AH-Plus Epoxy Resin Sealer"]},{"label":"Groupe 3: Bio-C Sealer","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Bioceramic sealer (Bio-C Sealer, ANGELUS, BRA)","interventionNames":["Drug: Bio-C Sealer"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Zinc-Oxide Eugenol Sealer","description":"Zinc oxide-eugenol sealers have a slow setting time, shrinkage while setting, solubility, and can discolour tooth structure.
