Major hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgeries will be defined as follows-\n\n* Pancreaticoduodenectomy,\n* Hemihepatectomy or greater with or without caudate lobectomy\n* Extrahepatic bile duct resection\n* Extended cholecystectomy\n* Distal Pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy The primary Objective of the study would be to compare post operative major morbidities and early mortality (\\<90 day) in major HPB surgeries done for cancer patients with and without peri-operative hyponatremia. (\\<135mmoL/L). Development of systemic complications and long term outcomes (overall survival and disease free survival) will also be evaluated.\n\nIt will be an observational study consisting of both, a retrospective arm and a prospective arm. All consecutive patients undergoing major HPB surgery from 2010 till 30th June 2024 will be included in the study.","detailedDescription":"Primary objective: To compare post operative major morbidities and early mortality (\\<90 day) in major HPB surgeries done for cancer in patients with and without peri-operative hyponatremia.

Continuous variables- with Student t test and Mann Whitney U test as appropriate.\n  2. Categorical data - Chi square or Fischer exact test. Besides the above, appropriate analysis will be done at the time of final data analysis.\n  3. Significance will be seen at 5 % level (p\\<0.05).\n  4. Adequate subgroup analysis and multivariate regression analysis will be done.\n* Adverse effects - No adverse effect is expected to occur out of the study protocol.\n* Stopping rule - Not Valid"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Perioperative Hyponatremia","description":"Perioperative Hyponatremia \\<135 mEq/L"},{"label":"No Perioperative Hyponatremia","description":"No Perioperative Hyponatremia, i.e s.sodium \\>135 mEq/L"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Post operative major morbidities and early mortality (<90 day).","description":"Post operative major morbidities and early mortality (\\<90 day) in major HPB surgeries done for cancer. in patients with and without peri-operative hyponatremia.
