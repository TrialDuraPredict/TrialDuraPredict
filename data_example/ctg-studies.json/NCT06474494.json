All groups were light-cured for 10s/1,000 mW/cm2 only after final layer. A resin composite will be placed by applying three increments and each one will be light cured for 20s/1,000 mW/cm2. The restorations will be finished immediately with fine diamond burs and polishers. The restorations will be evaluated at baseline and after 6- and 12-months by using the FDI criteria. The following outcomes will be evaluated: retention, marginal staining, marginal adaptation, post-operative sensitivity and recurrence of caries. The differences among the groups will be calculated using Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance rank (α = 0.05).","detailedDescription":"This is a four-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Experimental group 1: 35 non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) will receive composite resin restorations applying a double layer of Scotchbond Universal Plus adhesive applied as etch-and-rinse mode.\n\nExperimental group 2: 35 non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) will receive composite resin restorations applying a double layer of Scotchbond Universal Plus adhesive applied as selective enamel etching mode.\n\nControl group 1: 35 non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) will receive composite resin restorations applying one layer of Scotchbond Universal Plus adhesive applied as etch-and-rinse mode.\n\nControl group 2: 35 non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) will receive composite resin restorations applying one layer of Scotchbond Universal Plus adhesive applied as selective enamel etching mode.\n\nLCNCs will be randomized to application mode and number of layers. All groups will be light-cured with a light-curing device (SmartLite Focus, Dentsply) with a light intensity of 900 mW/cm² for 10 seconds. Operators will restore the cervical area by applying three increments of resin (Filtek Supreme XT, 3M). Each increment will light cure for 20 s at 900 mW/cm2 (SmartLite Focus, Dentsply). Restorations will be finished immediately with fine and extra fine diamond burs and polished with polishing spirals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-carious Cervical Lesions"],"keywords":["Dental bonding","Tooth erosion","Tooth wear","Adhesive systems","Double layer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This is a four-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial.
