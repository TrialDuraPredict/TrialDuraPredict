The BMT-CARE intervention was developed with the goal of improving the experience and needs of caregivers of patients treated with HCT.\n\nCaregivers will be randomized into one of the two study groups: BMT-CARE plus usual care, or usual care.\n\nParticipation in this study is expected to last up to 180 days after HCT.\n\nInvestigators expect that about 400 caregivers and up to 400 patients treated with HCT will take part in this research study.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is supporting this research by providing funding."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bone Marrow Transplant Complications","Hematologic Malignancy"],"keywords":["Neoplasms by Site","Hematologic Diseases","Neoplasms","Hematologic Neoplasms"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":800,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BMT-CARE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized to BMT-CARE plus usual care will complete the following:\n\n* Questionnaires at baseline, and days 60, 90 and 180 post HCT.\n* Receive the BMT-CARE intervention from enrollment up to 60 days post-HCT.
