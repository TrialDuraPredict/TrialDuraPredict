This distressing phenomenon carries risks that are harmful to patients, caregivers and medical personnel. Using total intravenous Dexmedetomidine, we sought to reduce the incidence of agitation and provide gentle emergence from anesthesia.","detailedDescription":"Surgery for pediatric cleft lip and palate repair often utilizes high dose opioids and inhaled anaesthesia, thereby causing postoperative complications such as desaturation and/or severe agitation after anesthesia. These complications are detrimental to the child, medical personnel and causes tremendous psychologic stress to parents. Our aim is to decrease these complications through dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist with anxiolytic, sympatholytic and analgetic properties. Devoid of respiratory depressant effect, it allows patients to maintain effective ventilation and reduce agitation, postoperatively. Its unique anesthetic property may shed light to provide safe anesthesia and gentle emergence to this young, vulnerable population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Emergence Delirium"],"keywords":["Emergence Agitation, Delirium, Dexmedetomidine, Sevoflurane, Pediatrics, Cleft Lip, Cleft Palate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Pediatrics ages 3 months to 10 years","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Patients are selected randomly using a computer-generated device to become a control arm or a treatment arm","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Inhalation Sevoflurane","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants in this group will receive inhalation anesthesia Sevoflurane at 2-2.5 Vol% as their sole anesthetic maintenance agent throughout the surgical procedure.","interventionNames":["Drug: Inhalation Sevoflurane"]},{"label":"Total Intravenous Dexmedetomidine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will receive Total Intravenous Dexmedetomidine as their sole anesthetic maintenance agent.
