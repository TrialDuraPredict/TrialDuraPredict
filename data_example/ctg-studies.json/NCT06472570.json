Evaluation of the efficacy of the stereotactic boost applied in patients with head and neck tumours.\n2. Evaluation of the safety of the stereotactic boost applied in patients with head and neck tumours.\n3. Evaluation of the influence of the stereotactic radiotherapy boost on blood parameters reflecting tumour response (interleukin 6 (Il-6), thymidine kinase (TK), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)), and normal tissue response (C-reactive protein (CRP)).\n\nIn the case of beneficial findings, the stereotactic radiosurgery boost in the course of radio(chemo)therapy in patients with head and neck tumours will be able to replace traditional techniques of radiation, and radical schemes of treatment will be possible for future development."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Head and Neck Cancer"],"keywords":["stereotactic radiotherapy","radiosurgery boost","head and neck cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stereotactic radiotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery boost.
