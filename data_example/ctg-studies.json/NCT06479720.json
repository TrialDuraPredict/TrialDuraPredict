Patients were divided into three groups: combined pharmacotherapy with solifenacin and mirabegron, solifenacin with vaginal estrogen cream and mirabegron with vaginal estrogen cream. Incontinence-related symptoms distress and impact on quality of life were evaluated by short form of Urinary Distress Inventory, (UDI-6), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS).
