Standard of care treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer is chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor before the main treatment is given (neoadjuvant), followed by surgery to remove all of the bladder as well as nearby tissues and organs (radical cystectomy). In cases where patients are not candidates for the standard of care approach or prefer a bladder sparing option, tri-modality therapy with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used. Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of tumor cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. Giving enfortumab vedotin with pembrolizumab and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of enfortumab vedotin given in combination with pembrolizumab and concurrent radiation therapy (RT). (Phase Ib).\n\nII.

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with EV+pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these investigational products.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"UCSF Genitourinary Medical Oncology Recruitment","role":"CONTACT","phone":"877-827-3222","email":"GUTrials@ucsf.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Vadim Koshkin, MD","affiliation":"University of California, San Francisco","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of California, San Francisco","city":"San Francisco","state":"California","zip":"94143","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"UCSF Genitourinary Medical Oncology Recruitment","role":"CONTACT","phone":"877-827-3222","email":"GUTrials@ucsf.edu"},{"role":"CONTACT","email":"cancertrials@ucsf.edu"},{"name":"Vadim Koshkin, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.77493,"lon":-122.41942}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001749","term":"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000014571","term":"Urologic Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000014565","term":"Urogenital Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000052776","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000001745","term":"Urinary Bladder Diseases"},{"id":"D000014570","term":"Urologic Diseases"},{"id":"D000052801","term":"Male Urogenital Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M5534","name":"Carcinoma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5030","name":"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms","asFound":"Bladder Cancer","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17320","name":"Urologic Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17315","name":"Urogenital Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2875","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27093","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14127","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8399","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5026","name":"Urinary Bladder Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17319","name":"Urologic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27095","name":"Male Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"C000582435","term":"Pembrolizumab"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000074322","term":"Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological"},{"id":"D000000970","term":"Antineoplastic Agents"},{"id":"D000082082","term":"Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"},{"id":"D000045504","term":"Molecular Mechanisms of Pharmacological Action"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M349416","name":"Pembrolizumab","asFound":"Breast","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M1346","name":"Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2342","name":"Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"ANeo","name":"Antineoplastic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
