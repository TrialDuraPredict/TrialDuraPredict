This 6-month randomized controlled trial included 160 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Participants were divided into two groups: one received DS based on physician judgment, and the other based on GenAIS AI system analysis. Primary outcomes focused on changes in mental health scores, while secondary outcomes included quality of life, metabolic markers, and DS adherence. Data collection involved genetic, metabolic, and clinical profiling, with ethical considerations ensuring participant confidentiality and informed consent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mental Disorder"],"keywords":["AI-guided dietary supplementation","Genetic profiling","metabolic profiling","Depression management","anxiety management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Standard therapy group"]},{"label":"AI-Guided Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: AI-Guided group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard therapy group","description":"Participants receive supplement prescriptions from a physician based on current standard practices, which include biochemical markers, genetic data, and metabolic profiles.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"AI-Guided group","description":"Participants receive supplement prescriptions determined by GenAIS, is an AI system that considers genetic data, metabolic profiles, biochemical markers, and patient history.","armGroupLabels":["AI-Guided Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The primary endpoint is the percent change in mental health scores (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale) for the AI-Guided group compared with the Control group.","description":"The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a clinician-administered assessment used to measure the severity of depression in individuals.
