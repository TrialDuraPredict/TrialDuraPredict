The DC cells are isolated from the patient's blood and then cocultured with the gp96 to obtain the activated DC cell product. The manufactured DC cells are subcutaneously or intra-tumor injected into the patient. Clinical studies will be performed to test anti-cancer function of the DC vaccination for immunotherapy of cancer patients. In this phase I study, the safety, tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the DC vaccine immunotherapy on advanced cancers will firstly be evaluated.","detailedDescription":"1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced solid cancers, with written consent for this study;\n2. Perform biopsy to get fresh sample for generation gp96 protein; Collect DC cells from the cancer patient;\n3. Produce appropriate DC cell vaccine and deliver the vaccine into selected patients via local injections, and follow up closely to collect related results as required;\n4. To enhance the killing capability, cotreatment the patients with vaccine aduvants or PD1/PDL1/CTLA4 antibodies may be applied;\n5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Solid Tumor, Adult","DC"],"keywords":["Solid Tumor","DC Vaccine","gp96"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placental gp96 induced DC cell Vaccine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Biological: DC cell Vaccine"]},{"label":"Tumor-derived gp96 induced DC cell Vaccine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Biological: DC cell Vaccine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"DC cell Vaccine","description":"Deliver DC cell vaccine into patients for anti-ancer therapy.","armGroupLabels":["Placental gp96 induced DC cell Vaccine","Tumor-derived gp96 induced DC cell Vaccine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Patients with Dose Limiting Toxicity","description":"A dose limiting toxicity is defined as any toxicity that is considered to be primarily related to the vaccine, which is irreversible, or life threatening or hematologic or non-hematologic Grade 3-5.","timeFrame":"Six months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percent of Patients with best response as either complete remission or partial remission.","description":"Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients whose best response is either complete remission or partial remission by combining the data from the patients.
