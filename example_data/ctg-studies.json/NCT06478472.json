ECOG 0-2;\n6. Must have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion using the Lugano 2014 Lymphoma Efficacy Evaluation Criteria: i.e., PET/CT with an evaluable lesion; an intranodal lesion with a long diameter greater than 1.5 cm and a short diameter greater than 1.0 cm or an extranodal lesion with a long diameter of \\> 1.0 cm, as assessed by CT or MR\n7. Participants with splenic MZL who do not meet the above criteria for radiologically measurable disease are eligible, provided that the bone marrow infiltration of the MZL is histologically confirmed;\n8. HBV-positive serology (concealed carriers: anti-HBeAg +, HbsAg-, anti-HBsAg +/-) are eligible for enrollment only if they have a negative HBV-DNA test;\n9. Major organ function meets the following criteria: a) Blood routine: absolute neutrophil value ≥1.5×109/L, platelet ≥75×109/L, hemoglobin ≥75g/L; if accompanied by bone marrow invasion, absolute neutrophil value ≥1.0×109/L, platelet ≥50×109/L, hemoglobin ≥50g/L; b) Blood biochemistry: total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the ULN, AST or ALT ≤ 2 times ULN; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN; serum amylase ≤ ULN; c) Coagulation function: International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 times ULN. 10) Expected survival ≥ 3 months;\n10.
