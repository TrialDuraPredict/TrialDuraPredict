PAS can lead to severe postpartum hemorrhage or even maternal death. Prenatal diagnosis of PAS is essential for optimal obstetric management to improve the pregnancy outcomes. However, in some low resource regions in China, less than 20% PAS are detected before delivery.\n\nTo explore the feasibility and universality of the bundled prevention and treatment strategy for placenta accreta spectrum disorders in different levels of medical institutions, and to investigate its effectiveness in improving the specialized disease management capabilities of medical institutions at all levels. We will conduct a regional, cluster-randomized trial to assess a multicomponent PAS management strategy to improve the prepartum detection rate of PAS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Placenta Accreta Spectrum"],"keywords":["placenta accreta spectrum disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"study group","description":"Theoretical training, technical supporting and standardized referral process"},{"label":"control group","description":"usual care"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"antepartum diagnosis rate of PAS","timeFrame":"through study completion, an average of 1.5 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant women who have regular prenatal examination at the research hospitals\n* Pregnant women diagnosed with PAS before or after delivery\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant women who have never been diagnosed with placental implantation disease throughout the pregnancy\n* Pregnant women who were lost to follow-up during the study period","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Pregnant women with placenta accreta spectrum disorders","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jinsong Gao","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0861069156225","email":"gaojingsong@pumch.cn"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010921","term":"Placenta Accreta"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007744","term":"Obstetric Labor Complications"},{"id":"D000011248","term":"Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000010922","term":"Placenta Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13811","name":"Placenta Accreta","asFound":"Placenta Accreta","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10764","name":"Obstetric Labor Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14127","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2875","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27093","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8399","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13812","name":"Placenta Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4583","name":"Placenta Disorder","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
