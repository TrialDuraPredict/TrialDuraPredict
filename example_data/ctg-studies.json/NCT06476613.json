The data collected from this pilot study will be used as preliminary data for study design and grant applications for a larger multicenter randomized controlled trial.","detailedDescription":"The investigators will perform a single center, open-label, randomized controlled trial in patients admitted to the HCICU after cardiac surgery at MGH. Patients who are hypotensive (MAP \\< 65mmHg) and/or require vasopressor support to maintain a MAP â‰¥ 65mmHg during the first 24 hours of ICU admission will be eligible for randomization. Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to either a) Permissive Hypotension (MAP target \\>60mmHg) or b) Usual Care. The duration of the intervention will extend until the patient no longer needs vasopressors to maintain prespecified MAP. Outcomes of interest include continuous hemodynamics (both recorded values from EHR as well as the arterial line waveform data), vasopressor exposure (as measured by maximum Vasopressor-Inotrope Score, mean Vasopressor-Inotrope Score, and duration of vasopressor use), lactate clearance, rates of atrial fibrillation, need for renal replacement therapy, ICU length of stay, survival to hospital discharge, cognitive state at discharge using Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. Additionally, the investigators will perform exploratory analyses using the continuous arterial line waveform data to evaluate for potential differences in arterial waveform morphologies between groups to help discern the hemodynamic impacts of permissive hypotension and to potentially identify subphenotypes who may derive greater benefit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Permissive hypotension Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In addition to the regular care provided to cardiac surgery patients, those in the permissive hypotension intervention arm will have a MAP target \\> 60mmHg.","interventionNames":["Other: Permissive Hypotension"]},{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients randomized to the standard of care arm will receive the regular care provided to cardiac surgery patients."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Permissive Hypotension","description":"Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to either a) Permissive Hypotension (MAP target \\> 60mmHg) or b) Usual Care.
