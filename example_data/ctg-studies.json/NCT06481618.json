The main question it aims to answer :\n\nhow does the ocurence of a stressfull event modify the ventilation delivered in term of pressure, frequency, volume.\n\nVolunter healthcare professionals will take part in a simulation where they will manually ventilate a manikin and ventilation datas will be recorded.","detailedDescription":"The lung simulator (ASL 5000TM, IngMar Medical) will be connected to a high-fidelity mannequin (SimMan 3G, Laerdal Medical). A continuous, cycle-by-cycle recording of the administered ventilatory parameters will be carried out (recording of pressure, volume and flow curves as a function of time). These curves will then make it possible to determine the main parameters of this ventilation (respiratory frequency, maximum and end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume, etc.).\n\nThe healthcare professional will be asked to carry out ventilation with Self-filling Bag With One-way Valve as he is accustomed to doing, during a standardized patient transfer.\n\nSubsequently, an unforeseen event will be added to the situation with continued continuous recording of ventilation modalities.\n\nThe personal data that will be requested from healthcare professionals will be: their age, their gender, their seniority in the profession, their place of practice. The stress of healthcare professionals will be assessed using a digital self-assessment scale and the use of a heart rate monitor.\n\nPrior stress and anxiety will be measured in advance by completing several questionnaires before starting the simulation (STAI-T, STAI E, AD ACL)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Any Healthcare Professional","Agreement to Participate","Who May be Required to Perform Manual Ventilation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ventilation quality","description":"Quality of ventilation under stress conditions in terms of frequency, pressure and volume delivered compared to the standards of the protective ventilation initially delivered","timeFrame":"1 hour"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any healthcare professional who may be required to perform manual ventilation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unavailability of simulation equipment\n* Refusal to participate","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Any healthcare professional who may be required to perform manual ventilation with Self-filling Bag With One-way Valve, available to participate in this work and not opposed to their inclusion in this study.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Lise Laclautre","role":"CONTACT","phone":"334.73.754.963","email":"promo_interne_drci@chu-clermontferrand.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Thomas Godet","affiliation":"University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de Clermont-Ferrand","city":"Clermont-Ferrand","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Lise Laclautre","role":"CONTACT"},{"name":"Thomas Godet","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.77966,"lon":3.08628}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"}},"hasResults":false}
