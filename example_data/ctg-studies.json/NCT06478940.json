Accordingly, a combination of multiple antibiotics seemed to be essential to diminish different types of pathogenic bacteria. Recently, a combination of three antibiotics (Metronidazole, cefixime, and Ciprofloxacin) along with Statins (new bio-inductive materials in regenerative dentistry) has shown promising results in primary teeth pulp therapy.\n\nStatin components have an anti-inflammatory impact on pulp tissue by lowering the amount of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. They also decrease osteoclastic processes and strengthen osteoblastic processes. Thus, they promote bone regeneration and dentin formation by enhancing odontoblastic activity. Several studies have shown a clinical and radiographic success rate of 3Mixtatin with inconsistent results. Some randomized controlled Trials (RCTs) showed that MTA had a comparable result with 3Mixtatin, while others reported that 3Mixtatin might be an alternative for MTA due to its higher overall success rate. 3Mixtatin is considered as a novel material with successful outcomes. Owing to limited availability of data in researches and in order to reach a conclusive results our study aims to evaluate clinical and radiographic success of using 3Mixtain versus mineral trioxide aggregate in pulpotomy of deeply carious Primary molars ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pulp Disease, Dental","Deciduous Teeth"],"keywords":["pulpotomy - vital pulp therapy","primary molars- baby teeth"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MTA pulpotomy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"pulpotomy with MTA applied in the vital pulp therapy","interventionNames":["Drug: MTA pulpotomy"]},{"label":"3 Mixtatin pulpotomy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"pulpotomy with 3 mixtatin (triple antibiotic paste of (Metronidazole, cefixime, and Ciprofloxacin mixed with simvastatin ) applied in the vital pulp therapy","interventionNames":["Drug: 3 mixtatin pulpotomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"3 mixtatin pulpotomy","description":"pulp treatment with applying 3mixture of antibiotic (Metronidazole, cefixime, and Ciprofloxacin) along with simvastatin","armGroupLabels":["3 Mixtatin pulpotomy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"MTA pulpotomy","description":"pulp treatment with applying MTA","armGroupLabels":["MTA pulpotomy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical success Clinical success clinical success","description":"absence of postoperative pain,Absence of pain on percussion,Absence of Swelling and Absence of Sinus or fistula","timeFrame":"1 week , 3 months , 6 months , 9 months and 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Radiographic success radiographic success","description":"Absence of any adverse radiographic findings (Periodontal membrane space widening, bone resorption, pulp stones, internal or external root resorption )","timeFrame":"3 months , 6 months , 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* • Children 4-8 years old\n\n  * Vital deeply carious primary molars.\n  * No history of spontaneous pain, pathologic mobility, draining sinus tract, redness or swelling of the vestibule.\n  * Normal gingival and periodontal condition, with no sensitivity to vestibular palpation, and no pain on percussion test.\n  * Patient and parent showing cooperation and compliance.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* • Uncooperative children to avoid time waste and attrition bias.\n\n  * Unrestorable molars\n  * Sign of radiolucency in periapical or furcation area\n  * Widening of PDL space or loss of lamina dura continuity\n  * Evidence of internal/external pathologic root resorption\n  * During operative procedure, when hemorrhage control is not achievable after pulpotomy.\n  * Children with systemic disease as some systemic diseases may have effect on the outcome.\n  * Unable to attend follow-up visits to avoid attrition bias by decreasing number of drop off cases.\n  * Refusal of participation as the parent of child has the authority of participation.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"4 Years","maximumAge":"8 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sally A kotb, PHD researcher","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00201001656502","email":"sallyqutb9933@gmail.com"},{"name":"Eslam M Mahdy","role":"CONTACT","phone":"00201143683135","email":"eslam.mahdy@dentistry.cu.edu.eg"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Randa y Abd Al Gawad, professor","affiliation":"Professor of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"},{"name":"Yasmin M Yousry, Associate professor","affiliation":"Assistant Professor of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"38433296","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Almarji W, Laflouf M, Tolibah YA.
