Providers are required to communicate TGP risks to patients and elicit patient preferences for managing information (i.e., \"opt out\" or have genetic counseling) because of the possibility of uncovering secondary hereditary cancer risks found on this test. Yet barriers exist to support optimal decision-making. Limited study of genetic links to cancer has been done with Latinx patients making them an important understudied group to target for genetic decision support. Shared cultural values among Latinx individuals such as familismo (family loyalty) and fatalismo (fatedness) may influence how patients approach cancer risk assessment and genetics and language and acculturation barriers, access and affordability, deportation risks, medical mistrust and low genetic knowledge impact decision making. As a result, Latinx patients are less likely to participate in clinical genetic testing. Adding to this vulnerability is the fact that many oncologists may not have a good understanding of how to effectively communicate secondary hereditary risks to Latinx patients. This leaves Latinx patients without the support they need to make good decisions about what they would want to do about secondary results from TGP that is in line with their needs, preferences and values.\n\neHealth interventions can promote health behavior change when developed with targeted messages, but many fall short if they do not effectively address the core barriers to a health decision. Gene PilotLX was developed using commercial marketing techniques to ensure saliency. Using perceptual mapping and vector message modeling, the investigators have shown in our parent Gene Pilot study that was conducted among AA/Black cancer patients that this approach provides a superior methodology for developing effective, persuasive messages that result in significant behavior and decisional conflict changes.\n\nA fully powered randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 232 Latinx cancer patients at four oncology sites to evaluate the efficacy of Gene PilotLX,an electronic health decision support tool. Participants will be randomized either to intervention arm and watch Gene PilotLX or usual arm and review patient information about TGP presented in a written document (pdf). All participants will complete three assessments: baseline, immediate post intervention, and 1-3-month surveys."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer"],"keywords":["eHealth decision tool","Hispanic/Latino","Tumor Genomic Profiling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":232,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gene PilotLX","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Gene PilotLX is an eHealth decision support tool that is designed to empower Latinx cancer patients to decide their preferences for learning about secondary genetic information, communicate those preferences to their doctors, and provide the opportunity to discuss information with their families or others to feel they have made an informed decision.
