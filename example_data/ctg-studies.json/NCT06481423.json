The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nDoes CBT-I delivered via smartphone apps improve sleep quality evaluated by scales in patients with insomnia?\n\nInvestigators will compare the treatment group receiving the CBT-I intervention via smartphone apps to a control group receiving relaxation training to see if there are significant improvements in sleep quality.\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\nUse an app(\"ForSleep\") designed for CBT-I to follow a structured therapy program.\n\nComplete daily sleep diaries and periodic scales to track their sleep quality.","detailedDescription":"All participants sign the informed consent form online. The study is an online, single-blind, parallel-group, superiority randomized experiment of digital CBT-I(dCBT-I). The randomization is performed using stratified random sampling to ensure non-significant differences in age, gender, and basic sleep quality between the two groups. The screening, informed consent, assessments, allocation to conditions, delivery of the interventions, scale evaluations, and follow-ups are all carried out online. WeChat chatting groups for daily notification and communication are set up respectively. The experiment lasts 5 (and more) weeks included 3 weeks of intervention and 2 weeks of follow-up.\n\nAll participants are required to keep sleep diaries. They self-evaluate via Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS), Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess insomnia severity, sleep-related cognition, and behaviors at 5 time points. The first 3 times are at the first day, after 7 days and 14 days, before starting each new session. After 3-week program, the above scales are retaken during days 22\\~25 and days 36\\~39 as follow-ups. The evaluating time is different on account of individual rate of progress to accomplish the 3-week program.\n\nDigital cognitive behavioral therapy is delivered using an app developed by Fudan University. Digital intervention is structured into 3 sessions with a 7-days course in each session. The intervention group undertook 3 weeks of tasks which consisted of cognitive, behavioral, and relaxation parts of CBT-I and typically lasted 15 minutes per day. Two pieces of relaxing music are recommended daily to the control group instead of the standard relaxation practice. All participants have access to 30 relaxing music and articles on sleep hygiene that are made available in the app."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Insomnia"],"keywords":["Digital cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia","Chronic Insomnia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive digital cognitive behavioral intervention for insomnia(dCBT-I) via their smartphone, and can freely access relaxing music in the app","interventionNames":["Behavioral: dCBT-I","Behavioral: Relaxing music"]},{"label":"Control Group","type":"OTHER","description":"Participants can only freely access relaxing music in the app. They don't have access to dCBT-I","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Relaxing music"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"dCBT-I","description":"A digital cognitive behavioral intervention course that addresses multiple aspects such as basic sleep knowledge, sleep hygiene, sleep behaviors, improving negative cognition, and improving emotions.
