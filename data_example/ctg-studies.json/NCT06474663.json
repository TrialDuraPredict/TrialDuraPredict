Baseline ejection fraction must be \\> 40%.\n6. Adequate hepatic function (direct bilirubin \\< 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless increase is due to Gilbert's disease or leukemic involvement, and AST and/or ALT \\< 5x ULN unless considered due to leukemic involvement, in which case direct bilirubin or AST and/or ALT \\< 5x ULN will be considered eligible).\n7. Adequate renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min) unless related to disease. (Justification on page 7-8)\n8. In the absence of rapidly proliferative disease, the interval from prior treatment to time of initiation will be at least 14 days for cytotoxic or non-cytotoxic (immunotherapy agent(s), or an interval of 5 half-lives of the prior therapy. Oral hydroxyurea and/or cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2) for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy, as needed, for clinical benefit and after discussion with the PI. Concurrent therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS disease is permitted.\n9.

Participants who weigh less than 10kg.\n2. Participants with any concurrent uncontrolled medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness which could place the participant at unacceptable risk of study treatment.\n3. The use of other chemotherapeutic agents or anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during study with the following exceptions (1) intrathecal chemotherapy for prophylactic use or for controlled CNS leukemia. (2) use of hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease or for control of counts during differentiation syndrome. (3) use of steroids for treatment of differentiation syndrome.\n4.
