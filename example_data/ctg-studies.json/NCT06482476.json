Despite its significance, clinical attention for elevated Lp(a) is suboptimal. This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) levels among volunteer medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece, as well as gather data on the demographic characteristics and medical history of this population. Statistical analysis will assess Lp(a) levels, prevalence, and associations with demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. The study aims to provide valuable insights into the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) among Greek medical students, emphasizing the importance of awareness, early diagnosis, and management of this cardiovascular risk factor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Insight Into the Prevalence of Elevated Lp(a) Among Greek Medical Students"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"ECOLOGIC_OR_COMMUNITY","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"description":"Blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":246,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Med students","description":"Medical students in whom Lp(a) levels will be measured","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Measurement of Lp(a) levels"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Measurement of Lp(a) levels","description":"Collection of a venous blood sample for the measurement of Lp(a) levels using standardized laboratory methods","armGroupLabels":["Med students"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lp(a) elevated","timeFrame":"At time of measurement"},{"measure":"Lp(a) beneath cut-off","timeFrame":"At time of measurement"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability/unwillingness to give informed consent","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Volunteer medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Fotios Barkas, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+306936636376","email":"f.barkas@uoi.gr"},{"name":"Marios Kourtidis, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+306987415932","email":"markourtidis@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Fotios Barkas, MD, PhD","affiliation":"University of Ioannina","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital of Ioannina","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Io√°nnina","state":"Ioannina","zip":"45000","country":"Greece","contacts":[{"name":"Fotios Barkas, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+306936636376","email":"f.barkas@uoi.gr"},{"name":"Marios Kourtidis, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+306987415932","email":"markourtidis@gmail.com"},{"name":"Fotios Barkas, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Marios Kourtidis, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.66486,"lon":20.85189}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000050171","term":"Dyslipidemias"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000052439","term":"Lipid Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M26181","name":"Dyslipidemias","asFound":"Dyslipidemia","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11639","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27029","name":"Lipid Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
