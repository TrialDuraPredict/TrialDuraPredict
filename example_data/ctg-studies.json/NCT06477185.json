The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does doxycycline have a significant anti-fibrosis role when given as adjuvant therapy to TB patients with advanced pulmonary TB in a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial?\n* How does long term respiratory function defer between patients who received adjuvant doxycycline aimed at prevention of TB associated lung fibrosis and those who received a placebo in a double blind randomized controlled trial?\n\nParticipants will be subjected to the following:\n\n* Experimental arm: Doxycycline 100 mg once daily for 12 weeks administered concurrently with standard of care anti-TBs.\n* Comparator arm: Placebo once daily for 12 weeks administered concurrently with standard of care anti-TBs.","detailedDescription":"This will be a double-blind randomized block stratified clinical trial. Participants will be enrolled if they have advanced drug sensitive TB evidenced by infiltrates/lesions in at least 2 zones on a chest X-ray, among other inclusion criteria.\n\nParticipants will receive 100mg of doxycycline or matching placebo once a day for 12 weeks in addition to standard anti TB therapy.\n\nParticipants will undergo baseline high resolution CT scans to evaluate lung parenchyma involvement and repeat CT scans at 12 months to score TB associated fibrosis.\n\nLung function assessment with spirometry will be done at 6 and 12 months after enrolment to assess trends of lung function in the control and intervention study arms.\n\nProfibrotic cytokines (TGFbeta) and Matrix metalloproteinases (1, 3 ,8,9) will be measured at baseline , 3 and 6 months after enrolment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized placebo-controlled trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Double blind study","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention: Doxycycline","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Oral doxycycline (100 mg) administered once daily for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Doxycycline"]},{"label":"Control arm","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Oral placebo (matching with doxycycline) will be administered once daily for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Doxycycline","description":"Doxycycline is a bacteriostatic tetracycline antibiotic with ability to immunomodulate matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes well known to cause lung damage via breakdown lung extracellular matrix.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention: Doxycycline"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"This will be a chemically inert substance, designed to match oral doxycycline capsules but with no chemically active ingredients.","armGroupLabels":["Control arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean High resolution CT (HRCT) fibrosis scores","description":"Quantified fibrosis scores (e.g. 0 - 25) will be derived from the CT interpretation tool, and recorded for each participant at baseline and 12 months' HRCT images, and compiled per treatment arm.\n\nMean scores per study arm (intervention and control) will de determined for both baseline and 12 months' HRCT scans.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Efficacy of doxycycline as an anti-TB associated fibrosis agent","description":"This will be estimated or analyzed using analysis of covariance method.
