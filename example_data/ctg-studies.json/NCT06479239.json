Participants receive 8 weekly doses and then 8 more doses every 2 weeks of EGFR FPBMC by intravenous infusion.","detailedDescription":"Once subjects are determined to be eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via leukapheresis procedure. The T cells in the mononuclear cells are coated with bispecific antibody to activate the T cells and the mononuclear cells are reinfused into the patients so the T cells can multiply and kill tumors.\n\nAbout 72 hours after the leukapheresis procedure, EGFR FPBMC infusions will start. After about 8-9 weeks, participants will have another leukapheresis procedure and then receive doses every 2 weeks for 8 more doses. Before, throughout and following EGFR FPBMC, research blood will be collected to better understand immune response. Disease status will be checked regularly during and after study treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pancreas Cancer","Pancreatic Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"EGFR Fresh Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will undergo apheresis to collect cells to make EGFR fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (FPBMC).
