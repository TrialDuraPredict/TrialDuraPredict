The study has been initialized in 2024 and included older residents. The goal of this observational study is to explore the risk factors related to disability and dementia in the elderly Chinese community population, and develop a risk prediction model for disability and dementia.","detailedDescription":"This is a community-based prospective cohort study in China. Individuals who were aged 60 years or older, had lived in the communities for more than 1 year, and had signed the informed consent form were enrolled in the present study. The study has been initiated in 2024 and aimed to explore the risk factors related to disability and dementia in the elderly Chinese population, and develop a risk prediction model for disability and dementia. This work consists of three steps as follows. First, by integrating the data of the elderly cohort of 4 communities in Beijing, Shenzhen, Haikou and Hangzhou, we plan to establish a Chinese elderly database. Second, to explore the risk factors of disability and dementia in elderly Chinese. Third, to construct risk prediction models of disability and dementia in Chinese elderly."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Age Problem","Disability","Dementia","Death"],"keywords":["Disability, Dementia, Ageing, Cohort"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Plan to obtain blood samples from some of the participants"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6780,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Total","description":"All subjects","interventionNames":["Other: No intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"No intervention","description":"No intervention","armGroupLabels":["Total"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The prevalence and incidence of functional disability using a population-based survey","description":"Functional disability was measured by Activities of Daily Living, cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and movement disorderï¼ˆShort Physical Performance Battery) collected by questionnaires.The minimum value of the Activities of Daily Living is 0, and the maximum value is 100, the higher the score, the better the outcome.The minimum value of the Mini-Mental State Examination is 0, and the maximum value is 30, the higher the score, the better the outcome.The minimum value of the Short Physical Performance Battery is 0, and the maximum value is 12, the higher the score, the better the outcome.","timeFrame":"An average of 1 to 2 years"},{"measure":"The prevalence and incidence of mild cognitive impairment using a population-based survey","description":"Mild cognitive impairment was measured using Mini-Mental State Examination collected by questionnaire.The minimum value of the Mini-Mental State Examination is 0, and the maximum value is 30, the higher the score, the better the outcome.","timeFrame":"An average of 1 to 2 years"},{"measure":"The prevalence and incidence of dementia using a population-based survey","description":"Dementia was determined by diagnosis of hospitalization or diagnosis of death or Clinical Dementia Rating scale.
