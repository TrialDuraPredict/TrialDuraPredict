Furthermore, it's also related to decreased quality of life and high mortality. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a first-line treatment and can also be used for the prevention of depression.\n\nThis randomized controlled clinical trial is planned to have 50 participants randomized between an interventional and a control group (waiting list). Our study covers young adults (18 to 24 years old) with depression. Participants will be invited by social media to undergo treatment in an IPT group. The intervention group will be separated into groups with up to 10 participants, with a weekly meeting for eight weeks. The intervention will focus on interpersonal relationships within the model of IPT and will be held by a university student and a doctor trained in IPT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression","Interpersonal Relations"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention","type":"OTHER","description":"Participants that receive psychotherapy","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Interpersonal psychotherapy"]},{"label":"Waiting list","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants that are waiting for intervention"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Interpersonal psychotherapy","description":"Interpersonal psychotherapy is a first-line treatment and can also be used for the prevention of depression.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient Health Questionnaire-9","description":"Depression Scale","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF)","description":"Quality of life Scale","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)","description":"Depression and Anxiety Scale","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20)","description":"Psychiatric symptoms","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Social support scale (MOS-SSS)","description":"Social support perception","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Attachment (RSQ)","description":"Attachment and relationship","timeFrame":"Week 1 and 8"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)","description":"General Health","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Resilience (CD-RISC-10)","description":"Resilience Scale","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression (CGI)","description":"Clinical Impression","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment, Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Psychotherapy side effects (UE-ATR checklist)","description":"Psychotherapy side effects","timeFrame":"Week 1 to 8"},{"measure":"Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)","description":"Childhood Trauma","timeFrame":"Week 1"},{"measure":"Life Stressful Events Questionnaire","description":"Trauma Events","timeFrame":"Week 1 to 8"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Young adults (between 18 and 24 years old) who work, live or study in Porto Alegre, PHQ â‰¥ 5 - without suicide ideation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Maniac or hypomanic episode, Psychotic Syndrome ,Substance Abuse, Suicide Risk or Ideation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"24 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Neusa Sica da Rocha, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"55(51) 3359-8000","email":"nrocha@hcpa.edu.br"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Clinical Hospital for Porto Alegre","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Porto Alegre","state":"RS","zip":"90035-903","country":"Brazil","contacts":[{"name":"Neusa Sica da Rocha, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(5551) 3359-8000","email":"nrocha@hcpa.edu.br"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":-30.03306,"lon":-51.23}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003863","term":"Depression"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001526","term":"Behavioral Symptoms"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7058","name":"Depression","asFound":"Depressive Symptoms","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7061","name":"Depressive Disorder","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4818","name":"Behavioral Symptoms","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
