Participants will undergo a regular rehabilitation program incorporating these natural healing factors, measuring outcomes through various health metrics.","detailedDescription":"This interventional clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of incorporating natural healing factors into the standard rehabilitation regimen for patients suffering from degenerative small joint disease. The study will involve a well-defined cohort of participants diagnosed with this condition, randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which will receive the combination of mineral water and mud procedures with a regular rehabilitation program, or the control group, which will receive the standard regular rehabilitation.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine patients' functional status and quality of life changes, measured through validated health questionnaires and functional tests specific to small joints. Secondary objectives include analysing the socio-economic impact, reducing temporary incapacity for work and disability rates and improving patient participation in daily activities and employment.\n\nThe data collection process will be rigorous, involving a comprehensive mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Participants will be required to complete health surveys and functional status tests and provide socioeconomic data at multiple points throughout the study. The rehabilitation program will include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and the application of natural healing factors such as balneotherapy and peloid therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Osteoarthritis","Hand Osteoarthritis","Foot Osteoarthritis"],"keywords":["balneotherapy, peloid therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study employs a parallel-group design, where participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: an experimental group receiving the enhanced rehabilitation program with natural healing factors and a control group receiving the standard rehabilitation program.
