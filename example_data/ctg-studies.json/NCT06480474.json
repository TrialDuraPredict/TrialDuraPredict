The program has shown to be efficacious in different trials with major depression and depression as a comorbidity of another disorder (e.g., gambling addiction, epilepsy). The objectives of this project are:\n\nPrimary Objective: To test the effects of the self-help web-based program on depressive symptoms in French-speaking individuals in Switzerland.\n\nSecondary Objective A: To test the effects of the online program on reward responses for individuals with depressive symptoms.\n\nSecondary Objectives B and C: To test the effects of the role of peer-to-peer support using an online forum in addition to an online program (B) and comparison between Switzerland and India (C).\n\nThis project can inform clinicians about what they can offer as a treatment to individuals, either in combination with psychotherapy or when there is no quick or direct access to a psychotherapist. The study promises to have a direct practical significance for people suffering from depression.","detailedDescription":"Depression is one of the most frequent mental disorders that affect society and individuals psychologically and financially. The text revision of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) defines characterized depression as a minimum of 2 weeks of low mood or loss of interest in daily activities, accompanied by vegetative, motor, and cognitive symptoms. Depressed individuals may also have suicidal thoughts or tendencies. However, not everyone receives adequate care and there is a treatment gap. The causes of the treatment gap are diverse and include the difficulty in accessing treatment, the lack of mental health specialists in a region or a country, the fear of stigmatization, cultural beliefs about mental health, etc.. Technologies such as Internet-based self-help interventions are promising to reduce the burden of depression and to address the treatment gap. Several meta-analyses found that these interventions are effective in reducing depression. Internet-based self-help interventions are easily available, can be utilized regardless of time and location, and can be provided to a large population simultaneously. Although Switzerland has a well-developed mental health care, the treatment gap for depression in Switzerland is estimated to be 51% and depression represents a strong societal burden. The main aim of this study will be to examine the efficacy of a web-based self-help intervention for depression in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nMoreover, anhedonia is a core symptom of depression. It is defined as a loss of pleasure or a lack of reactivity when faced with pleasurable stimuli . Hedonic capacity decreases with depression, such as a reduced reactivity to pleasant cues or diminished reward responsiveness . Reward processes are shown to induce positive or pleasurable experiences . Specifically, there might be a strong association between the presence of anhedonia in depressed patients and dysfunction of the reward system . One secondary objective (A) of this project is to examine reward responses and sensitivity in individuals with depressive symptoms and more specifically, the effect of an online intervention for depression on reward responses. Finally, whereas the effect of therapist support (in the form of guidance during the treatment) in internet-based self-help programs is well investigated, the role of peer support within internet-based self-help has not yet been fully understood. There is evidence suggesting that patients' mutual exchange via integrated discussion forums can increase the efficacy of Internet-based treatments and could help to overcome adherence issues of Internet-based self-help programs. Further secondary objectives (B and C) of this study are to investigate the effects of the role of peer-to-peer support using an online forum in addition to an online program and comparison between Switzerland and India."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Depression"],"keywords":["depression","online intervention","internet-based treatment","online study","peer-support","randomized control trial","India","Switzerland"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"We will use a controlled randomized design with 3 conditions (1.
