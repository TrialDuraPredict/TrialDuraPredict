effect of a lacking corpus luteum on maternal cardiovascular and metabolic adaption to pregnancy by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","detailedDescription":"The use of programmed frozen embryo transfer cycle (FET) in IVF women is associated with an increased risk of obstetric complications (pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage and placenta accreta) compared to FET in natural cycle.\n\nThe lack of corpus luteum in programmed cycles and the subsequent absence of circulating vasoactive substances may lead to an impaired cardio-vascular adaption to pregnancy and thereby an increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia.\n\nThe cardiovascular and metabolic adaption to pregnancy is evaluated throughout pregnancy by use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as non-invasive measurements by use of elastography and seismocardiography.\n\nPatients are screened for preeclampsia throughout pregnancy with measurements of blood pressure, urine samples as well as blood samples."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["IVF","Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET)","Cardiovascular Adaption","Magnetic Resonance Imaging
