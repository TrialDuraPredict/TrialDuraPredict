The primary objective is to assess whether the PN program can significantly reduce time to completion of infertility evaluation and to initiation of fertility treatment (if recommended) for infertile patients from an underserved patient population.\n\nThe study aims are to:\n\n1. evaluate the impact of the PN program on timelines including obtaining commercial insurance coverage for infertility, expediting labwork/imaging, weight management, and partner urology appointments, and initiating fertility treatment; and\n2. ascertain the medical literacy of participants with a validated tool to assess the impact of low medical literacy on PN facilitation.\n\nParticipants will be contacted by the PN and provided with a survey instrument that will test their medical literacy. Then the PN will assist with scheduling cycle-based testing including labwork and uterine cavity evaluation, the partner's urology appointment, the patient's appointments such weight management/nutrition referral, mammograms (if indicated by age), and insurance counseling if the participant's current insurance does not cover infertility diagnostic testing and treatment. These tasks are part of pursuing fertility care at BMC.\n\nDuration of evaluation and time to treatment in age-matched control patients from the year prior that did not have PN services will be utilized as a comparison group.\n\nRegression analyses will be conducted to explore the association between utilization of a PN and pregnancy rates, considering potential confounding factors.\n\nEstablishment of the pilot program will enable the investigators to apply for a larger institutional patient care grant going forward. Strategies developed through this research can may enhance fertility care access for underserved communities across various healthcare settings. By tailoring interventions to populations not usually able to access specialized healthcare services, this study pioneers a paradigm shift towards inclusivity and equity in reproductive medicine."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Infertility"],"keywords":["Infertility Patient Navigator (PN)","Under-resourced patients","Cycle based testing","Urology appointments","Health
