The study will compare the effects of two different hand cycling approaches-steady-state and interval efforts-on improving hand dexterity in people with PD. Conducted as a clinical trial, it aims to understand if a single session of hand cycling can temporarily enhance hand function and if the nature of the exercise influences the benefit.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of hand cycling, an upper limb aerobic exercise, on hand function in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD).\n\nParkinson's Disease affects motor skills, including hand dexterity, which can impede daily activities. While aerobic exercise is known to have benefits for people with PD, the specific impact of upper limb exercises like hand cycling on hand function is less studied. Previous research suggests aerobic exercises can improve symptoms and motor function in PD. This study aims to fill the gap in understanding how hand cycling affects hand dexterity in PD. There is no placebo involved in this study as it compares two active intervention types: steady-state and high-intensity interval hand cycling.\n\nThis is a block randomized parallel group clinical trial involving a single session of exercise intervention. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: steady-state or high-intensity interval hand cycling. The study includes baseline assessments, the exercise intervention, and post-intervention assessments to evaluate changes in hand function.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the time to complete the 9-hole pegboard test with the clinically more affected hand. Secondary endpoints include changes in motor examination scores, finger tapping speed, and subjective measures of exercise perception. Analysis of covariance will be used to compare the primary outcome between groups, accounting for baseline performance and clinical characteristics. The planned sample size is 20 people with PD, aiming to capture varied clinical expressions of the disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Upper Limb","Aerobic Exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Interval","description":"Participants in the interval condition will begin with a gradual one minute warm up effort with a ramp in the resistance gradually increasing from 0 watts to 60% of their peak power output (Wpeak) over 1 minute.

During the work intervals participants will be encouraged to apply the highest cadence they can produce for the 15 second interval and resume a freely chosen cadence in the rest periods.
