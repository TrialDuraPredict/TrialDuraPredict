The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* whether an app can successfully deliver an intervention to parents of young infants\n* whether parents who learn about torticollis will increase behaviors intended to prevent torticollis compared to parents who learn about general infant development\n\nParticipants will complete a monthly survey for 6 months asking about their parenting behaviors. Researchers will compare parents who receive notifications about torticollis with parents who receive notifications about general infant development to see if increased knowledge of torticollis leads to preventive behavior."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Torticollis"],"keywords":["prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":56,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"in-app twice-weekly parent notification about torticollis and head turn asymmetries","interventionNames":["Behavioral: in-app notification"]},{"label":"control","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"in-app twice-weekly parent notification about general infant development"}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"in-app notification","description":"Parents will receive bi-weekly prompts in a baby monitor app to change infant's orientation within crib, allow for tummy time several times per day, alternate the side from which infants are fed, alternate the side the infant faces during carrying, and in general note any side preferences of the infant so that positioning can assist in symmetry.","armGroupLabels":["intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"symmetry score","description":"extent of infant's head turn asymmetry","timeFrame":"baseline and 4 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"gaze asymmetry score","description":"extent of infant's eye gaze asymmetry","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"time spent in focused attention","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"# of bouts of focused attention","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"correlation between computer vision algorithm & manual coding for infants' head turns","timeFrame":"4 months"},{"measure":"Correlate computer vision score with clinical test of symmetry","timeFrame":"4 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* any parent with an infant under a month old who can answer a survey in English\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* infant already has a diagnosis of torticollis or plagiocephaly","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Day","maximumAge":"1 Month","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED","description":"Individual participant data that underlie results reported in published articles, after deidentification, as well as the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, and informed consent form, will be available beginning 9 months and ending 5 years following publication.\n\nOnly investigators whose proposed use of the data has been approved by a learned intermediary shall have access to conduct analyses as approved in the proposal."}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000059041","term":"Plagiocephaly"},{"id":"D000014103","term":"Torticollis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000004421","term":"Dystonia"},{"id":"D000020820","term":"Dyskinesias"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000019465","term":"Craniofacial Abnormalities"},{"id":"D000009139","term":"Musculoskeletal Abnormalities"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000000013","term":"Congenital Abnormalities"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M29382","name":"Plagiocephaly","asFound":"Plagiocephaly","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16858","name":"Torticollis","asFound":"Torticollis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7595","name":"Dystonia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22575","name":"Dystonic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M22574","name":"Dyskinesias","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12404","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12","name":"Congenital Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M21420","name":"Craniofacial Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12096","name":"Musculoskeletal Abnormalities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12097","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4584","name":"Plagiocephaly","asFound":"Plagiocephaly","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC16","name":"Diseases and Abnormalities at or Before Birth"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
