Participants will be assessed annually. Clinical data, including clinician-reported outcomes and patient-focused outcomes, will be entered into a clinical database customized to the requirements of this specific study (SCA27B Registry; www.ataxia-registries.org). Digital-motor outcomes comprise digital gait assessment by wearable sensors, and digital assessment of upper limb movements by Q-Motor. At all study visits, participants will be asked to donate biosamples; and participants can elect to participate in sampling of blood, urine, CSF, and/or a skin biopsy. Based on this multimodal protocol, the study aims to determine the most sensitive, comprehensive, and reliable outcome measures for future therapeutic trials in SCA27B."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 27B"],"keywords":["ataxia","SCA27B","FGF14","Natural History Study","Outcome Validation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"24 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Biosample collection including blood (DNA, serum, plasma, RNA, PBMC) and urine; and optional CSF and skin biopsy"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SCA27B","description":"Participants with genetically confirmed SCA27B (OMIM 620174), i.e. ≥250 uninterrupted GAA repeat expansions in FGF14, will be recruited.
