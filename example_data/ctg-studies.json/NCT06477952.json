All participants will take oral Dronabinol for two weeks. Sleep studies will be conducted before and after treatment to measure OSA severity.","detailedDescription":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is a serious respiratory disorder that involves repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep. It is estimated that 15-20 million people in the United States suffer from OSAS, which has been linked to increased risk for hypertension, heart failure, depression, and diabetes. The current standard of care for OSA, positive airway pressure (PAP), involves a mechanical device with low patient tolerance and adherence. Upper airway surgical approaches are also an option but are invasive and often unsuccessful. Effective drug treatments for OSA remain to be identified.\n\nThis study will enroll up to 120 Veterans so that 45 Veterans may complete the two-week open-label Dronabinol treatment trials. The results of the study will be used to develop a prediction model for OSA severity reduction after 2-week Dronabinol treatment vs. pretreatment AHI. Participants clinical (age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity) and pretreatment polysomnographic characteristics (sleep architecture, respiratory disturbance, and endotypes; loop-gain, arousal threshold, upper airway collapsibility and compensation) will be used to develop a prediction model for improvement of OSA with Dronabinol treatment. This prediction model will be used for a randomized clinical trial after the completion of this trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea"],"keywords":["OSA","sleep apnea","pharmacological treatment","Drug treatment"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"120 Veterans will be screened and enrolled to achieve 45 participants completing the study.
