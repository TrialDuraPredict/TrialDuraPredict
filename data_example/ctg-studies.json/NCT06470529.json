Data was obtained from the Iranian Network of Cardiovascular Research Registry ( which registered post PCI patients all around Iran in more than 40 public and private hospitals) and the database of Professor Kojuri Cardiology Clinic (Niyayesh St., Shiraz, Iran, www.kojuriclinic.com). After each procedure, expert cardiologists recorded baseline demographic data, prior medical history, angiography, and angioplasty reports.\n\nDemographic data such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family history of CAD, prior CAD history, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLP), and kidney diseases were obtained from the database. Data on the prevalence of cigarette smoking, opium addiction, and alcohol addiction were collected. Additionally, information on clinical manifestations of the disease, including stable angina, unstable angina, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), was extracted.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association (AHA), stage 1 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 80-89 mmHg ; Hypertension was defined as stage 1 or higher blood pressure. DM was defined according to The American Diabetes Association as having a hemoglobin A1c level of at least 6.5%, a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 126 mg/dl or higher, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) level of 200 mg/dl or greater, or a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dl or above . For defining dyslipidemia, based on the 2019 AHA guideline, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level exceeding 160 mg/dl or a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) over 190 mg/dl were considered . Individuals with ≤1 month of smoking cessation were considered current smokers .\n\nAngiography and angioplasty data Angiography and angioplasty data were gathered, including the type and location of coronary artery lesions and the type, location, size, diameter, and number of stents. Drug-eluting stents encompass a variety of types, notably the biolimus-eluting stent (BES), amphilimus-eluting stent (AES), SES, ZES, PES, and EES. Within the BES category, a notable example is the BioMatrix™ stent, while SES includes options like BioMimeTM, Orsiro®, Cre8, SUPRAFLEX, ULTIMASTERTM, and Coroflex® ISAR. ZES variants include the Resolute Onyx™ and Resolute Integrity™ stents, whereas EES comprises options such as Promus PREMIER, Promus Element™, and XIENCE™. Polymer-coated drug-eluting stents (PC-DES) include BioMatrix™, BioMimeTM, Orsiro®, SUPRAFLEX, ULTIMASTERTM, Resolute Onyx™, Resolute Integrity™, Promus PREMIER, Promus Element™, and XIENCE™. Conversely, polymer-free drug-eluting stents (PF-DES) are exemplified by Cre8 and Coroflex® ISAR. Regarding generational classification, the first generation includes BioMimeTM, Orsiro®, Cre8, SUPRAFLEX, ULTIMASTERTM, and Coroflex® ISAR. Notable second-generation members are Promus PREMIER, Promus Element, and XIENCE™, alongside Resolute Onyx™ and Resolute Integrity™. Finally, the BioMatrix™ stent represents the third generation.\n\nData of ballooning, including predilatation, postdilatation, and the number of balloons used were collected. Different angioplasty techniques, including kissing and overlapping were collected .Coronary legions were classified according to the ACC/AHA classification: type A: \\<10 mm, non-angulated, smooth, little calcification, not totally occlusive, not ostial, no major branch involvement, no thrombus; type B: 10-20 mm, eccentric, moderately tortuous, 45-90º, irregular, moderate to heavy calcification, ostial, bifurcation lesions, some thrombus (subcategories: B1: one characteristic; B2: two or more characteristics), and type C: diffuse, extremely angulated, \\>90º, inability to protect major side branch, degenerated vein graft .\n\nFollow-up Patients were contacted by phone to explain the study plans and obtain informed consent. They were asked about MACEs occurring within two years following angioplasty, which includes myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, stroke, and death from cardiac diseases, as well as any revascularization. Additionally, the date of MACE occurrence after angioplasty was recorded, and information on non-cardiac-related deaths was collected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Artery Disease","Stent Restenosis"],"keywords":["Percutaneous coronary intervention","Major adverse coronary events (MACE)","drug eluting stents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4159,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PCI","description":"Post PCI patients with drug eluting stents","interventionNames":["Device: drug eluting stents"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"drug eluting stents","description":"different types of drug eluting stents","armGroupLabels":["PCI"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Major adverse coronary events","description":"Total sum of Myocardial infarction (MI), Hospital admission, Death, reoperation or re PCI,","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with coronary angioplasty who received at least one type of DES\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who received multiple types of stents\n* Patients who need emergency operation post PCI","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"36 Years","maximumAge":"82 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients all around the Iran, from 40 hospitals, who undergone PCI as elective or emergency patients","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences","city":"Shiraz","state":"Fars","zip":"713481433","country":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","geoPoint":{"lat":29.61031,"lon":52.53113}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"Data was available based on rational request"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003324","term":"Coronary Artery Disease"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000003327","term":"Coronary Disease"},{"id":"D000017202","term":"Myocardial Ischemia"},{"id":"D000006331","term":"Heart Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000001161","term":"Arteriosclerosis"},{"id":"D000001157","term":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M6546","name":"Coronary Artery Disease","asFound":"Coronary Artery Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M19506","name":"Myocardial Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6549","name":"Coronary Disease","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10543","name":"Ischemia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9419","name":"Heart Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4469","name":"Arteriosclerosis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4465","name":"Arterial Occlusive Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17400","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"T217","name":"Mace","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T240","name":"Nutmeg","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"HB","name":"Herbal and Botanical"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
