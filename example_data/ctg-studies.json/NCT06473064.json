It manifests itself physiologically (adolescence, puberty, and old age) as well as pathologically (androgen insufficiency caused by drugs or disease, testicular tumors, hyperthyroidism, and chronic renal failure).\n\n* In spite of the variety of methods and tools such as (liposuction and circumareolar inframammary inscion ) used in gynecomastia surgery, in gynecomastia the results are satisfactory in grades 1 and 2 while grades 3 and 4 gynecomastia present a surgical challenge.\n* As some postoperative frustrating problems still cannot be completely eliminated, the most common of these are a saucer-like deformity (over resection under areola), bleeding, followed by seroma, infection, ischemic necrosis of nipple areola complex residual gynecomastia (under resection), persistence of inframammary fold, contour irregularities, and asymmetries between breasts.\n* the objective, in this research, is to demonstrate the The role of Benelli technique in removal of gynecomastia grade 3 and grade 4 in clinical and cosmetic outcomes","detailedDescription":"â€¢ The aim of this study the investigator determines the feasibility and cosmetic outcomes of Benelli technique for nipple sparing mastectomy in cases of grade 3 and 4 gynecomastia"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Surgical Managment of Gynecomastia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"* The Nipple areola complex (NAC )margins on both sides are marked as circular.\n\n  * Around the initial circle, a second circle (external) was drawn 1 cm broader than the boundary.\n  * The skin was resected, with deepithelialization between the two circles.\n  * A transdermal incision was made through the border of the external circle.\n* The breast tissue around the pedicle was lifted over the pectoral fascia and excised by preserving the NAC and the underlying breast pedicle\n\n  -The base of the mammary pedicle under the NAC was infixed at the farthest end of the mastectomy area by using 3/0 absorbable multifilament suture material\n* Hence, the space formed after mastectomy was filled with a breast pedicle located posterior to the NAC.\n* The closure of the circular deepithelialized area around the NAC with a diameter of 1 cm accomplished by using 4/0 absorbable monofilament suture material and the surgery was completed","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"grade 3 and 4 gynecomastia","type":"OTHER","description":"To evaluate and determine the posibility of complication of benelli technique for nipple sparing mastectomy in surgical treatment of grade 3and 4 gynecomastia and its cosmetic effect","interventionNames":["Other: Benelli technique for nipple sparing mastectomy in surgical treatment of grade 3 and 4 gynecomastia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Benelli technique for nipple sparing mastectomy in surgical treatment of grade 3 and 4 gynecomastia","description":".The Nipple areola complex (NAC )margins on both sides are marked as circular. -Around the initial circle, a second circle (external) was drawn 1 cm broader than the boundary.\n\n* The skin was resected, with deepithelialization between the two circles.\n* A transdermal incision was made through the border of the external circle.\n\n  -.
