The available data suggest that the advancement of immunotherapy from relapsed/refractory (R/R) field to the frontline setting may be an important approach to increase the depth of remission, which ultimately translates into a survival benefit. In this study, the investigators propose a treatment regimen using CAR-T cell therapy as a consolidation method for Ph- B-ALL patients achieving complete remission (CR) with chemotherapy, aiming to reduce the total cycles of chemotherapy and related toxicities, shorten length of hospitalization, and ultimately improve patients' survival and quality of life.","detailedDescription":"The CAR-T cells were murine-derived second-generation CD19 CAR-T with a co-stimulation domain of 4-1BB, and the infusion dose was 1×10\\^6/kg CAR+ cells in a single infusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Philadelphia Chromosome Negative ALL","Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Adult"],"keywords":["Philadelphia Chromosome Negative Precursor B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia","CAR-T cell","Venetoclax","Newly Diagnosed"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":77,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ph-ALL patients receiving CAR-T cells as consolidation therapy after achieving complete remission (CR) with pediatric-inspired regimen and venetoclax.","interventionNames":["Combination Product: CAR-T cells","Drug: Venetoclax"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"CAR-T cells","description":"CAR-T cells as consolidation therapy","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Venetoclax","description":"VEN","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells"],"otherNames":["Selective inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Disease-free Survival (DFS)","description":"From CR1 to relapse, death from any cause or last follow-up","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years post-registration"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MRD-negative complete remission rate measured by flow cytometry.","description":"No blasts were detected by flow cytometry when CR criteria were met after induction therapy.","timeFrame":"After induction (4 week)]"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"From the date of registration to the date of death resulting from any cause.","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration"},{"measure":"Event-free survival (EFS)","description":"From the date of registration to the date of induction failure, relapse, death from any cause, or last follow-up","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration"},{"measure":"MRD-negative complete remission rate measured by NGS tracking clonal IG/TR rearrangements","description":"No clonal IG/TR rearrangements were detected by NGS","timeFrame":"Up to 1 year post-registration"},{"measure":"Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR)","description":"Calculated with the cumulative incidence method, with death in patients who had a complete hematologic response as a competing risk.","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years post-registration]"},{"measure":"The rate of adverse events","description":"adverse events during the treatment","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
