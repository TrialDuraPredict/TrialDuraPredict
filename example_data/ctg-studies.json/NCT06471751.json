OSAS corresponds to a certain number of interruptions (apneas) or reductions (hypopneas) of ventilation during sleep. The weakening of the tone of the inspiratory and oropharyngeal muscles is one of the main causes of upper airways obstruction during the inspiratory phase.","detailedDescription":"For patients with moderate OSAS, with few or no symptoms, without associated cardiovascular comorbidities, there is no recommended treatment. Rehabilitate the inspiratory and oropharyngeal muscles through muscle strengthening seems to be an alternative to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a complete rehabilitation care evaluating the effectiveness of the strengthening of inspiratory and oropharyngeal muscles in subject with moderate OSAS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obstructive Sleep Apnea"],"keywords":["Inspiratory Muscles Training","Oropharyngeal training"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Strengthening muscles group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Home training to strengthen Inspiratory and Oropharyngeal muscles","interventionNames":["Other: Inspiratory and Oropharyngeal Muscle Strengthening"]},{"label":"No training group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No intervention"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Inspiratory and Oropharyngeal Muscle Strengthening","description":"Patients will conduct the training at home, 5 days a week for 3 months.
