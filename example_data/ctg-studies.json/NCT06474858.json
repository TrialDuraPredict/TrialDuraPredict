Furthermore the investigators will evaluate if body composition or body fat distribution has effects on symptoms and performance.","detailedDescription":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Obesity are two major health problems. The prevalence of both is growing and there is a complex interaction between COPD and obesity. On the one hand obesity impairs lung function, with decreasing static lung volumes being the most significant effect. On the other hand there seems a beneficial role of obesity on lung function in COPD patients. This is because obese COPD patients tend to have less hyperinflation than non-obese COPD patients . An interesting question is what the net effect of these changes in lung function is on respiratory symptoms and quality of life.\n\nIn this observational study, the investigators will compare obese and non-obese COPD patients. Pulmonary function, dyspnea and quality of life will be compared between the two groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COPD","Obesity","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"],"keywords":["COPD","Obesity","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Dyspnea","HRQoL","Symptoms","Dynamic hyperinflation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":166,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normal weight","description":"COPD patients with BMI 18.5-24.99"},{"label":"Obese","description":"COPD patients with BMI â‰¥ 30"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dyspnoea - mMRC","description":"Level of dyspnoea perceived in daily life measured using the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale.
