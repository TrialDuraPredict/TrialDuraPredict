HES can damage the lungs and airways, intestines, skin, and other organs. The current primary treatment for HES can cause serious side effects. Secondary treatments do not work in all people.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test an approved drug (dupilumab), combined with other drugs, in people with HES.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older who take drugs (mepolizumab, reslizumab, or benralizumab) to treat HES.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have up to 6 clinic visits and 7 remote visits in up to 48 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have a test of their heart function. They will take surveys about how HES affects their daily life. Some participants may have a bone marrow biopsy: A sample of tissue and fluid from inside a bone will be removed with a large needle.\n\nParticipants will have other tests specific to their symptoms. For example, those with symptoms affecting their lungs will have breathing tests. Others may have tests that target symptoms in their sinuses, gastrointestinal tract, or skin.\n\nDupilumab is injected under the skin once every 1 or 2 weeks. Dose and timing will vary among participants. They will be taught how to inject themselves at home between clinic visits. They will take dupilumab plus their current medications for 24 weeks. If the drug is helping them, they will continue taking it for another 24 weeks.\n\nParticipants will have a final visit 12 weeks after their last dose.\n\n...","detailedDescription":"Study Description:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of dupilumab in reducing clinical manifestations in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and persistent eosinophil-related pulmonary, skin, gastrointestinal, or sinus symptoms despite eosinophil reduction in response to eosinophil-lowering biologic therapy. Patients who meet criteria for HES and are currently receiving mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab with persistent symptoms (as above) despite absolute eosinophil count (AEC)\\<0.5x10\\^9/L will be eligible to enroll. Participants will be treated with dupilumab at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved doses for asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) depending on their residual symptoms Participants will have clinical evaluations and AEC measured every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Participants who remain in clinical remission and have an AEC\\<0.5x10\\^9/L will be eligible to continue dupilumab therapy for an additional 24 weeks with tapering of background therapy (other than the eosinophil-lowering biologic) as clinically tolerated.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To assess the efficacy of add-on dupilumab therapy in reducing residual pulmonary, skin, esophageal, and sinus symptoms in patients with HES in complete hematologic and partial clinical remission on eosinophil-lowering biologics\n\nSecondary Objective: To determine the effect of eosinophil-lowering therapy on dupilumab-induced blood eosinophilia and eosinophil-associated AEs\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: Clinical improvement on dupilumab therapy at 24 weeks, as assessed by HES-Most Bothersome Symptom (HES-MBS) and HES-Symptom Inventory (HES-SI)\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n1. Incidence of new or worsening symptoms or signs attributable to eosinophilia requiring therapeutic intervention through week 24\n2. Peripheral blood AEC at 4, 12, and 24 weeks.\n3.
