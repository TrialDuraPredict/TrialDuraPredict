Cushing's disease is a rare and serious disorder where the body makes too much of a hormone called cortisol. The main goals of this trial are to learn about\n\n1. the effect of Lu AG13909 on cortisol levels.\n2. the safety and tolerability of Lu AG13909.\n3. the pharmacokinetic parameters of Lu AG13909 (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, and processed by the body)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cushing's Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lu AG13909","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will first receive Lu AG13909 intravenously (IV) per predefined dosing schedule.
