Criminal legal involved BMSM are particularly vulnerable to HIV, and oftentimes experience delayed uptake and benefit from available HIV services. Status neutral interventions for criminal legal involved BMSM hold significant promise in supporting Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plans including enhancing access to HIV, mental health, and substance use services post-release; expanding the skills of the HIV workforce; and addressing the social and structural barriers to HIV services (e.g., unemployment) experienced by this population. The underlying tenet of status neutral interventions is a holistic or whole person approach to service delivery that meets the needs of clients regardless of their HIV status. There is a dearth of implementation science research in this domain, generally, and specifically for criminal legal involved BMSM. In September 2023, in addition to BMSM, community partners have prioritized Black transgender/gender non-conforming individuals and Black cisgender women who have sex with men as key populations for inclusion in J-RISE. Thus, J-RISE will be expanded to include these populations. The following status neutral evidenced-informed/promising interventions will be implemented to improve HIV, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and employment-related outcomes: (1) Health Navigation (HN) - leading with status neutral health navigator, a foundational intervention, to enhance access to HIV, mental health, substance use, and other supportive services; followed by (2) Employment navigation (EN) -status neutral employment navigators dedicated to supporting client employment, training, and career development needs; and coupled with (3) Contingency Management Intervention (CMI) - the provision of financial incentives for the uptake and achievement of specific HIV care and prevention milestones. Bringing these interventions together will maximize their independent effectiveness and provide significant promise for addressing the social and structural barriers to HIV services for key populations that are highly impacted by HIV. J-RISE will be guided by robust implementation science and equity frameworks (i.e., CFIR: Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, RE-AIM: Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance, and MIPA: Meaningful Involvement of People Living with and Impacted by HIV) and tools (e.g., implementation outcomes crosswalk and implementation research logic model). The implementation evaluation will study seven proposed implementation strategies: (1) Building a cross-site learning collaborative; (2) conducting readiness assessments; (3) providing cross-site training for the status-neutral interventions; (4) facilitating ongoing calls with interventionists; (5) monitoring financial incentives; (6) conducting audit and feedback to support implementation; and (7) engaging clients and consumers in the intervention.\n\nStudy Aim:\n\nAim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of two packaged status neutral interventions (Health Navigation versus Health Navigation + Employment Navigation + Contingency Management Intervention) on primary outcomes (i.e., linkages to HIV, PrEP, and employment-related services within 90 days) and secondary outcomes (i.e., receipt of HIV/STI testing, receipt of mental health and substance use services, retention in HIV and PrEP care, viral suppression, employment within 180 days and sustained employment) among enrolled participants. The investigators will conduct a pragmatic 2-arm randomized control trial (RCT) with N=350 enrolled participants randomized 1:1.\n\nAim 2. Explore the deployment of seven prioritized implementation strategies to enhance the adoption, implementation, and sustainment of the packaged status neutral interventions as it relates to nine key implementation outcomes (i.e., reach, acceptability, feasibility, adoption, fidelity, penetration, effectiveness, cost, engagement, and sustainability). The investigators will utilize a mixed method approach to complete this aim."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["HIV","Contingency Management","Justice Involved Populations","Status Neutral Interventions"],"keywords":["HIV","Contingency management","Justice involved populations","Status neutral interventions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":350,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Health Navigation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Referrals to HIV, mental health, substance use, and other supportive services","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Health Navigation"]},{"label":"Health Navigation, Employment Navigation plus Contingency Management Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Referrals to HIV, mental health, substance use, and other supportive services Referrals for employment including training, and career development needs; Provision of financial incentives for the uptake and achievement of specific HIV care and prevention milestones.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Health Navigation, Employment Navigation plus Contingency Management Intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Health Navigation","description":"Participants meet with Health Navigator twice in-person and receive 7 check-ins from the Health Navigator over a 6 month period.
