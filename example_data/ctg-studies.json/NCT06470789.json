It involves the use of devices such as air sleeves or elastic bands with adjustable functions during sports training that restrict blood flow to parts of the limb, resulting in an adaptive effect similar to high-intensity training in the muscles, while actually using relatively light weights. BFRT is usually combined with light exercise, such as low-load strength training or aerobic training, to build muscle strength and muscle endurance. This training method is more friendly to patients after sports injuries ， fractures, joint surgery ， etc. It can help to train the injured area with light loads to reduce muscle atrophy and speed up recovery to restore muscle function and strength. BFRT is also commonly used by athletes in different sports to improve muscle strength and endurance while reducing weight load, helping to reduce the risk of overtraining and injury.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Shoulder blood restriction training"]},{"label":"Massage","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Massage is a widely used traditional Chinese physical therapy technique, which uses massage, kneading, pushing, flicking, tapping and other techniques, as well as the use of the palm, fingertips, elbows, knees and other body parts to stimulate specific body areas or acupoints to achieve the purpose of treatment or relief of disease symptoms . Massage massage can relieve musculoskeletal pain by promoting blood circulation, relaxing tense muscles and reducing inflammation, and improve muscle elasticity and flexibility, helping to reduce muscle tension and stiffness . Therefore, massage massage is often used to improve the treatment of local body pain, and a large number of studies have shown that massage massage can reduce shoulder pain in the short term, restore shoulder function and improve the range of motion of shoulder joints .","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Shoulder blood restriction training"]},{"label":"BFRT combined massage group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To observe the effect of blood flow restriction equipment combined with low-load shoulder resistance training and massage intervention on shoulder pain, function, strength and joint motion of judo athletes with shoulder joint dysfunction.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Shoulder blood restriction training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Shoulder blood restriction training","description":"Massage massage is also often used to improve the treatment of local body pain, and a large number of studies have shown that massage massage can reduce shoulder pain in the short term, restore shoulder function and improve the range of motion of shoulder joints.","armGroupLabels":["BFRT combined massage group","Massage","blood flow restriction training"],"otherNames":["massage"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Shoulder strength","description":"In this study, a muscle force tester was used to measure the maximum force of the subjects' shoulders.
