Assessing whether the percentage of samples adequate for WES (Whole Exome Sequencing)/WT (Wild-Type) sequencing is at least 80%.\n\nII. Development of a data bank of WES/WT and germline sequencing data for future analyses.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients receive genomic counseling and genomic testing education, undergo blood or saliva collection, provide previously collected tissue sample and have medical records reviewed on study.
