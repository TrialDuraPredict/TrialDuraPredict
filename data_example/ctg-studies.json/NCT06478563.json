Participants are being asked to participate in both phases. Phase A of this study is comparing two formulations of a study medicine called NNC0487-0111 for weight control in people with overweight or obesity. Phase B of this study is testing how taking NNC0487-0111 at the same time as a meal affects the way NNC0487-0111 works in participants body. The aim of this study is to compare how two different formulations of NNC0487-0111 behave in the body, and how their function is affected when they are taken with or without a meal. Participants will either get NNC0487-0111 Formulation C, or NNC0487-0111 Formulation D. Both formulations are given as tablets. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Oral NNC0487-0111 is a new medicine which cannot be prescribed by doctors but has previously been tested in humans. The study will last for about 5 - 6 months (155-184 days)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity","Overweight"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Phase
