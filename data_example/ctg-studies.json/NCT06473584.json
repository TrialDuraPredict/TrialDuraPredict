Given the specific population characteristics of Réunion compared with Finland, where this score has been validated, it would seem important to be able to measure these risk indicators in the population as a function of carbohydrate status in order to check that the proposed thresholds are appropriate for the population of Réunion.\n\nFinally, cardiovascular risk has been described as early as the pre-diabetes stage. Given the young age of onset of diabetes in Réunion and the high proportion of diagnoses of diabetes made following the occurrence of a cardiovascular complication, the study of the prognosis of carbohydrate status on the occurrence of complications using the social security information system will be offered on a voluntary basis to study subjects (via a probabilistic social security link)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Detection of glycaemic anomalies","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Diabetes detection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Diabetes detection","description":"Fasting glycemia on blood sample","armGroupLabels":["Detection of glycaemic anomalies"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Estimating the prevalence of glycaemic abnormalities (diabetes and pre-diabetes) in Réunion","description":"Measurement of fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after ingesting 75g of glucose (HGPO test) according to Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) recommendations used in France for diagnosing diabetes and pre-diabetes in people with unknown diabetes","timeFrame":"Day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have lived in Réunion island for at least one year\n* Be aged between 18 and 75\n* Affiliated to or benefiting from a social security scheme\n* Free, informed and signed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No main residence on the island or fixed address for at least one year on the island\n* Participation in experimental research\n* Pregnant women\n* Adults under guardianship or legal protection\n* Not understanding French","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Catherine MARIMOUTOU, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+262 (0)262 90 50 50","email":"catherine.marimoutou@chu-reunion.fr"},{"name":"Laetitia Berly, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+262 262906286","email":"laetitia.berly@chu-reunion.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Catherine MARIMOUTOU, MD, PhD","affiliation":"CHU La Réunion","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"},{"id":"D000011236","term":"Prediabetic State"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D000008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D000004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7115","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M14117","name":"Prediabetic State","asFound":"Pre-diabetes","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20295","name":"Glucose Intolerance","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11639","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25403","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7862","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
