The trial aims to understand how dietary changes affect the composition and function of the gut microbiome, together with immunological and metabolomic markers in serum in patients with melanoma and NSCLC who are undergoing standard-of-care treatment with neoadjuvant or adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors.","detailedDescription":"Several studies have shown that diet can modulate the gut microbiome and affect the biology of the immune system. The role of the high-fermented food diet and high-fiber supplementation on gut microbiome in patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy will be evaluated. Fermented diet and high-fiber supplementation rational: a high-fermented food diet promotes gut microbiome composition and lowers systemic inflammatory markers. Additionally, high fiber diet may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in immune checkpoint inhibitor treated cancer patients. The effect of high-fermented food and high-fiber supplementation on gut microbiome and systemic inflammation in patients with cancer will be examined. The results of this study will be used to help to design future dietary intervention trials in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Baseline diet information, stool and blood samples will be collected. Patients initially receive high-fermented food diet for 4 weeks, followed by 2-week break/observation period and then cross over to high-fiber supplementation for another 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks break/observation period. During break/observation period patients can eat any type of food, without dietary restrictions. During the dietary intervention period 24-hour dietary recall information will be collected, stool samples weekly and blood sample every 2-4 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer"],"keywords":["PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors","inflammatory cytokines","gut microbiota"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"high-fermented food + high fiber supplementation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Step 1: patients will consume high-fermented food\n\nStep 2: High fiber supplementation","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: High-fermented food","Dietary Supplement: High fiber supplementation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"High-fermented food","description":"Step 1: patients will consume high-fermented food","armGroupLabels":["high-fermented food + high fiber supplementation"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"High fiber supplementation","description":"Step 2: High fiber supplementation","armGroupLabels":["high-fermented food + high fiber supplementation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in cell frequency of gut microbiota composition","description":"Changes in gut microbiome diversity and function, evaluated with metagenomics, identify differentially abundant taxa and assess all genes in all organisms present in each fecal microbiota sample in pre- vs. post- each dietary using PERMANOVA.
