The aim is to look at whether it is feasible to use a mobile health application for improving medication adherence in persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and whether it is acceptable to that population.","detailedDescription":"Many interventions have been tried to improve the medication adherence of patients with schizophrenia. Individualized interventions using like setting alarms and using checklists have shown significant improvement in compliance with the medications. In the era of mobile applications most of the persons use mobile applications for multiple purposes, which have the potential to influence the life of a person in many ways. A meta-analysis conducted in 2016 showed that 66.4% of psychotic patients owned a mobile phone. A study conducted in North India found that 84.4% of patients with severe mental disorders owned a mobile phone. So if used properly it can also help in improving the life of a person with SZ.\n\nMany mobile applications have been used to improve medication compliance in general. But only a few mobile applications have specifically focused the persons with schizophrenia. Very few studies have investigated the efficacy of mobile applications to improve medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia. This study will be assessing the feasibility of developing a mobile application and using the application for improving compliance of medications in persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.\n\nPrimary aims:\n\n* To develop a mobile mental health application for the improvement of medication adherence in persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder\n* To assess the feasibility and the acceptability of using a mobile mental health application for improving the medication adherence of persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n• To assess the feasibility and the acceptability of using a mobile mental health application for improving the medication adherence of persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\n• To compare the Medication adherence rating scale scores before and after using mental health application for improving medication adherence in persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder\n\n1. Initial screening of the participants will be done by the psychiatrist( PI)( In the Psychiatry OPD )\n2. Persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who are in remission(In Remission for past 2 months) and attending the Psychiatry Outpatient department at Government Medical College, Palakkad will be recruited\n3. After taking informed consent participants will be assigned into intervention group\n4. Pre intervention assessments will be done ((e.g., Symptoms, the Medication Adherence using relevant scales)\n5. After the pre-intervention assessment, Mobile application will be installed into participants mobile phone(Instruction will be given on the features of the mobile application and how to use it )\n6. Participants will receive the intervention via mobile application installed to their mobile phone (patient will continue to take their regular medications including antipsychotics. Intervention via mobile application include psychoeducational videos, reminders, and virtual rewards and badges for completing the challenges to encourage adherence of medications)\n7. Duration of intervention will be three months\n8. Post-intervention assessment will be done within one week after completion of the intervention (e.g., symptoms, the Medication Adherence, feedback (Acceptance questionnaire)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Schizophrenia","Schizo Affective Disorder"],"keywords":["Schizophrenia","Schizo Affective Disorder","Adherence","Mobile app"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"To compare the Medication adherence rating scale scores before and after using mental health application for improving medication adherence in persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention via mobile app","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention via mobile application include psychoeducational videos, reminders, and virtual rewards and badges for completing the challenges to encourage adherence of medications","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Intervention via mobile application"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Intervention via mobile application","description":"Intervention via mobile application include psychoeducational videos, reminders, and virtual rewards and badges for completing the challenges to encourage adherence of medications","armGroupLabels":["Intervention via mobile app"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of Mobile app","description":"To assess the feasibility and the acceptability with a mobile mental health application for medication adherence in persons with SZ and schizoaffective disorder using Acceptability Questionnaire","timeFrame":"Baseline and after three months"},{"measure":"Acceptibility of Mobile app","description":"To assess the feasibility and the acceptability with a mobile mental health application for medication adherence in persons with SZ and schizoaffective disorder using Perception of treatment Acceptability scale (Score (0-5) 0= Not at all 5 =very much)\n\n)","timeFrame":"Baseline and after three months"},{"measure":"Adherence to medication","description":"To compare the Medication adherence rating scale scores before and after using mental health application for changing medication adherence in persons with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder","timeFrame":"Baseline and after three months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
