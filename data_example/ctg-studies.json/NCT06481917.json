Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven to depression (total D), giving two scores (maximum score for each = 21). To screen for anxiety and depressive symptoms, the following interpretation can be proposed for each of the scores (A and D) each of the scores (A and D):\n\n* 7 or less: no symptoms\n* 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology - 11 or more: definite symptomatology.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Questionnaire to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention","description":"The acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by a questionnaire after each home visit at 7 days and one month, with patients and caregivers in the intervention group.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"EQ-5D-3L scale score","description":"Changes in the quality of life of patients and caregivers one month after hospital discharge will be measured by changes in the EQ-5D-3L scale score.
