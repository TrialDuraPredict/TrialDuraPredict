A type of leukemia (blood cancer) that comes on quickly and is fast growing. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, there are too many lymphoblasts (early-stage white blood cells) in the blood and bone marrow. Also called ALL.\n\nThe registration criteria for this study are:\n\n* Never used BESPONSA before\n* \\<18 years at the start of treatment with BESPONSA\n\nAll patients in this study will receive BESPONSA according to the prescriptions.\n\nPatients will be followed up as follow.\n\n* Treatment phase: From the day of treatment initiation (Day 1) to Day 28 post-treatment to collect information on safety (e.g., adverse events).\n* Follow-up phase: From Day 29 post-treatment to Week 52 to collect information on VOD/SOS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Occurrence of adverse events","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days after the last administration"},{"measure":"Risk factors related to the onset of venoocclusive liver disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome","timeFrame":"Up to 52 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
