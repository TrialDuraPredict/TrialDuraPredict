They were randomly divided into simultaneous cognitive training with active transcranial magnetic stimulation group and simultaneous cognitive training with sham transcranial magnetic stimulation group. Patients receive treatment 3-7 days a week, and the daily treatment time is 20-40 minutes. The duration of treatment is 1-12 weeks. Before treatment, cognitive assessment, resting EEG, head MRI and PET examination were completed. Complete the overall cognitive assessment, resting EEG and MRI examination within one week after the treatment, and complete the overall cognitive assessment and PET examination at the follow-up 6 months after the treatment. Fill in the treatment side effect scale and adverse event form. Keep the original oral drug dosage unchanged during the treatment process."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["VaD-MCI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients were randomly assigned to the active stimulation group and sham stimulation group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Patients were randomly assigned to the active stimulation group and sham stimulation group, Patients，Care Provider and Outcomes Assessor did not know the patient grouping.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":164,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"simultaneous cognitive training with active transcranial magnetic stimulation group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients were assigned into simultaneous cognitive training with active transcranial magnetic stimulation group according to random number table","interventionNames":["Device: simultaneous cognitive training with transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"simultaneous cognitive training with sham transcranial magnetic stimulation group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients were assigned into simultaneous cognitive training with sham transcranial magnetic stimulation group according to random number table","interventionNames":["Device: simultaneous cognitive training with transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"simultaneous cognitive training with transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"simultaneous cognitive training with transcranial magnetic stimulation can enhance the therapeutic effect and improve brain function non-invasively.","armGroupLabels":["simultaneous cognitive training with active transcranial magnetic stimulation group","simultaneous cognitive training with sham transcranial magnetic stimulation group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Scale","description":"Evaluate the improvement of clinical symptoms","timeFrame":"1-12 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"resting EEG","description":"EEG power in multiple band","timeFrame":"1-12 weeks"},{"measure":"head MRI","description":"Changes of brain function by fMRI","timeFrame":"1-12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nMale or female VaD-MCI patients between the ages of 50-85; The psychological evaluation was in accordance with MMSE score of 18-26 (including 18 and 26) and CDR score of 0.5.\n\nThe inclusion criteria based on MRI examination include: ① Multiple supratentorial subcortical lacunae (3-20 mm) with or without white matter degeneration, or moderate and severe white matter degeneration (Fazekas score ≥2) with or without lacunae; ② White matter lesions such as cortical/watershed infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or other causes (such as multiple sclerosis) were excluded; ③ There was no medial atrophy of hippocampus or temporal lobe (MTA 0); Can cooperate to complete clinical research.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSuffering from any cause of disturbance of consciousness.
