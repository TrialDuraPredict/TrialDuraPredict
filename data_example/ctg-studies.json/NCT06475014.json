From our view, the surgeon's involvement in PSI planning and design can affect the PSI's accuracy. Some other benefits of in-hospital PSI included the use of any type of implant without depending on the manufacturer's software system, faster and cheaper. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the effect of in-hospital PSI in which the surgeons take part in the manufacturing job."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Knee Osteoarthritis","Knee Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"365 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Knee with OA","description":"Underwent Total Knee replacement Surgery, using 3D printed PSI,","interventionNames":["Procedure: Total knee replacement"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Total knee replacement","description":"Mechanical Alignment Using PSI Pre and post-operative CT Scan","armGroupLabels":["Knee with OA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Radiology outcome","description":"Position of implants compare to the plan on CT, measure the discrepancies by degree","timeFrame":"30/06/2023"},{"measure":"Clinical outcome, self-administered questionnaire","description":"Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score, from 0-96, lower is better","timeFrame":"30/06/2024"},{"measure":"Clinical outcome, by surgeon's evaluating","description":"The 2011 Knee Society Scoring System, from 0 to 100, higher is better","timeFrame":"30/06/2024"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"AP-ML dimesion","description":"Size of knee on stimulated bone resection slice, AP and ML dimension in millimeters","timeFrame":"30/06/2023"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, grade III, IV\n* Underwent total knee replacement using patient-specific intrumentation\n* With pre and post-operative whole limb CT-Scanners\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Paticipants with valgus knee deformity,\n* A history of hip arthroplasty,\n* Large bone defect that required augments.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Participants with severe osteoarthritis of the knee who underwent primary TKA","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Duong Dinh Toan, Ph.D","affiliation":"Hanoi Medical University","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Vinmec Times City Hospital","city":"Hanoi","state":"Hai Ba Trung","zip":"100000","country":"Vietnam","geoPoint":{"lat":21.0245,"lon":105.84117}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000010003","term":"Osteoarthritis"},{"id":"D000020370","term":"Osteoarthritis, Knee"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000001168","term":"Arthritis"},{"id":"D000007592","term":"Joint Diseases"},{"id":"D000009140","term":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"id":"D000012216","term":"Rheumatic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M12926","name":"Osteoarthritis","asFound":"Osteoarthritis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M22168","name":"Osteoarthritis, Knee","asFound":"Knee Osteoarthritis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4476","name":"Arthritis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10621","name":"Joint Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12097","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15045","name":"Rheumatic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6323","name":"Collagen Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC05","name":"Musculoskeletal Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
