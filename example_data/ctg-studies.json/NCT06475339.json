This project will determine the trade-off between faster mission completion and risk of heat strain and physical performance decrements. Completion of this project will allow military leaders to make informed decisions by understanding the impact of their choices on the magnitude of physical performance decrements and expected heat casualties, setting up hot weather missions for success."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hyperthermia","Fatigue;
