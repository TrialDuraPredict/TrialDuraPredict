They must also have PAD, confirmed by an ankle-brachial index under 0.90 or vascular imaging, and experience pain from walking with a pain level of at least 6 cm for at least 3 months. Their Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire score should be 5.5 or less, and they must be good candidates for SCS.\n\nThe study includes initial evaluation visits, follow up after their permanent SCS is placed and optimized 12 weeks in the clinic at this time the study interventions begin and the patient is followed for four weeks; two weeks of stimulation and two weeks of sham intervention in random order, and intervention evaluations. At each follow up visit pain, sensory, functional, vascular, and autonomic outcomes will be assessed, after which patients will return to standard SCS care.

Participants will be between 19 and 90 years old, have diabetes with symptoms of neuropathy, and have a starting pain level of at least 5 cm on a visual pain scale. They must also have PAD, confirmed by an ankle-brachial index under 0.90 or vascular imaging, and experience pain from walking with a pain level of at least 6 cm for at least 3 months. Their Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire score should be 5.5 or less, and they must be good candidates for SCS.\n\nThe interventions will include spinal cord stimulation versus sham stimulation using a cross over design. Evaluations will include 1 week follow up clinical visit, 2 week follow up clinical visit with vascular lab TcPO2 evaluation, 12-week post permanent SCS placement with randomization to receive either active spinal cord stimulation or sham stimulation at a 2 week interval, follow up visit 2 weeks later to change therapy, and finally 2 weeks later to resume regular spinal cord stimulation. At each follow up visit pain, sensory, functional, vascular, and autonomic outcomes will be assessed. The study intervention lasts for 4 weeks, after which patients will return to standard SCS care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Peripheral Arterial Disease","Painful Diabetic Neuropathy","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Chronic Pain","Spinal Cord Stimulation","Chronic Pain Syndrome","Limb Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"1:1 cross over design","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active Spinal Cord Stimulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Therapeutic spinal cord stimulation titrated at 12 weeks post operative at standard clinical practice.","interventionNames":["Device: Spinal cord stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham Stimulation","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Sub-threshold low frequency spinal cord stimulation to provide no analgesic benefit but serve as a sham control.","interventionNames":["Device: Sham stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Spinal cord stimulation","description":"active spinal cord stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Active Spinal Cord Stimulation"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Sham stimulation","description":"Sham stimulation","armGroupLabels":["Sham Stimulation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"High-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) effect on analgesia","description":"The hypothesis will test that high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improves analgesia by measuring Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores during interventions.
