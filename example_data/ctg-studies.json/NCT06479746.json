Fear can disrupt the natural process of birth, prolong the stages of birth and cause postpartum complications.Minimizing the fears experienced during birth can lead to more successful and comfortable births, a complication-free birth and less pain for both the woman and the baby.Therefore, emotional support from healthcare professionals is important.\n\nAim: The research was conducted to determine the effect of emotional support given during birth on the woman's birth duration, perception and fear.\n\nMethods:The population of the randomized controlled experimental study consisted of nulliparous women who applied for normal spontaneous birth to the Birth Unit of a State Hospital in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey (40 experimental subjects, 40 control subjects).While emotional support practices and standard care were applied to women in the experimental group, only standard care practices were applied to women in the control group. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form, Wijma Birth Expectation/Experience Scale (W-DEQ) Version A, Wijma Birth Expectation/Experience Scale (W-DEQ) Version B, and Women's Perceptions of Supportive Care Provided at Birth Scale.The forms were applied twice to women applying for birth: during labor (first follow-up) and the second follow-up within 2-4 hours after birth. Number and percentage distribution, chi-square test, t test in independent groups, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test, and Cohen d test were used in the evaluation of the data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["First Pregnancy"],"keywords":["Birth","Emotional support","Birth perception","Fear of birth","Birth duration"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Emotional support group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Empathetic approach, listening to the feelings and thoughts, welcoming the woman's behavior and expressions, telling her that she is breathing correctly, etc.), not judging the woman, being honest, using a soft and calm tone of voice, taking the baby or asking her opinion, encouraging her to endure the birth process, touching the woman and making physical contact, allowing her to practice her beliefs, showing the baby to the mother as soon as it is born and placing it in her arms.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Emotional support"]},{"label":"Standard of care Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The control group did not receive any treatment."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Emotional support","description":"Emotional support helps the woman giving birth effectively, meets her emotional needs and expectations, ensures her comfort, improves birth outcomes, increases her self-esteem, ensures a positive birth experience and facilitates her transition into the role of motherhood.","armGroupLabels":["Emotional support group"],"otherNames":["Control Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire version A (W-DEQ-A)","description":"The W-DEQ-A is a validated, to determine the level of birth fear experienced by pregnant women.Answers in the scale are numbered from 0 to 5 and are in a six-point Likert type.
