All the recruited patients need extraction of upper first premolars followed by canine retraction with maximum anchorage.\n\nThe patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups; either Double slot brackets or single slot-brackets group.\n\nIn Double slot bracket group, Canine retraction will be made on two 0.016'' StSt round wires, each in one of the slots of the double slot brackets. while in single slot-bracket group, Retraction will be made on one 0.017''Ã—0.025'' rectangular StSt arch wire .\n\nThe patients will be seen on a monthly basis for follow up visit for reactivation of retraction to maintain constant force during the study. An impression will be taken for the patients every visit, fabricated dental models will be digitally scanned. The scanned models will be used to monitor the rate of canine retraction.\n\nEvery patient will be asked to take a CBCT image of the upper arch pre Retraction and after the completion of study duration (3 months). After data collection, assessors will carry on the measurements blindly. Statistical analysis of the data will be done and the results will be compared to evaluate the effectiveness of both techniques for canine retraction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rate of Canine Retraction"],"keywords":["canine retraction","double slot brackets","Orthodontic tooth movement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"study is a randomized clinical trial, single-center, parallel group, two-arms with 1:1 allocation ratio","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor investigators can be blinded.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single-slot brackets","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Bonding of the upper arch up to second molars with Roth prescription 0.022x.028\" single slot brackets (MINI MS-American orthodontics)","interventionNames":["Device: Single-slot brackets"]},{"label":"Double-slot brackets","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Double slot brackets (SORTECH-South Orthodontic Technology) will be Bonded on the upper arch up to the second molars.
