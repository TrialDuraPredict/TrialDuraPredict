It will also learn about the safety of RMC-035. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\n* Does RMC-035 protect the function of kidneys after surgery?\n* Is RMC-035 safe?\n\nResearchers will compare RMC-035 in high dose, RMC-035 in low dose and placebo to see if\n\n* Kidney function better for participants treated with any of the RMC-035 doses?\n* What medical problems do participants have when receiving RMC-035?\n\nParticipants will\n\n* Receive 3 doses of RMC-035 or placebo: at the beginning of surgery, end of surgery and 24h after surgery\n* Have extra checkups and tests during their hospital stay\n* Visit the clinic at two extra occasions at 60 days and 90 days after surgery for checkups and tests"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Kidney Injury Following Open-Chest Cardiac Surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":161,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"RMC-035 high-dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RMC-035 60 mg","interventionNames":["Drug: RMC-035"]},{"label":"RMC-035 low-dose","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"RMC-035 30 mg","interventionNames":["Drug: RMC-035"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo (tris-buffer)","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"RMC-035","description":"Protein, a recombinant variant of A1M.
