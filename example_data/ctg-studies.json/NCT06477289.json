We will utilize remote peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) and questionnaires to evaluate difficulties with sleep. PAT assessments will occur remotely in the homes of participants.\n\nNeurocognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging evaluations will occur on the same day as a routine clinic visit.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nEvaluate the relationship between nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) and neurocognitive functioning (working memory and verbal comprehension) in children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease controlling for age, genotype, and social vulnerability.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\nAssess differences in white matter integrity, silent cerebral infarcts, neuroinflammation, and functional connectivity among children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease with and without sleep disordered breathing after controlling for age.\n\nAssess differences in self- and caregiver-reported mood and pain severity among children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease with and without sleep disordered breathing after controlling for age.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\nExplore the relationship between nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) and neurocognitive functioning (attention, processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, motor dexterity) in children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease controlling for age, genotype, and social vulnerability.\n\nAssess the feasibility of an ultraportable ring oximeter (BodimetricsCircul+ Ring) in children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease.\n\nAssess the concordance between the Circul+Ring with the WatchPAT in children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease.","detailedDescription":"Interested participants will be consented in-person or virtually. Consented participants will be mailed the equipment (WatchPAT and Circul+ Ring) to conduct the remote assessment. Additional questionnaires will also be sent via mail or email for the participant to complete prior to collecting data on sleep behaviors. After receiving the questionnaires and equipment, a virtual session will be conducted with the participant to provide education on how to use the equipment and complete the included questionnaires. Participants will wear the WatchPAT and Circul+ Ring overnight for three days and data will be captured remotely. After wearing the devices for three consecutive nights, the participant will attend a research visit within approximately the next two weeks where they will complete performance based neurocognitive assessments, behavioral rating forms, and neuroimaging."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sickle Cell Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluate the relationship between nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) and neurocognitive functioning (working memory and verbal comprehension) in children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease.","description":"A linear regression model will be used to assess the relationship between SpO2 and neurocognitive functioning after adjusting for age, genotype, and social vulnerability.","timeFrame":"Baseline remote sleep assessment over 3 days followed by in-clinic assessment."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assess differences in white matter integrity among children (ages 12-18) diagnosed with sickle cell disease with and without sleep disordered breathing.","description":"This study will measure resting-state BOLD signal in SCD patients after assessing nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation.
