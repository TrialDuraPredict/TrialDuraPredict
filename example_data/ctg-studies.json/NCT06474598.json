Promoting the re-growth of lost beta cells would be beneficial to people with Type 1 Diabetes because it would allow them to take less insulin by injection and would improve their overall blood sugar control while reducing the risk and rate of low blood sugars. This open-label dose selection study aims to determine the optimal dose ofMTX228 for use in a future phase IIb study.\n\nThe purpose is to investigate the relative effectiveness of different doses of MTX228 and to select the most effective dose for further investigation in a phase 2b study.","detailedDescription":"MTX228 was developed as a treatment for gastric ulcers but did not advance beyond phase 2 clinical trials because of lack of efficacy. Subsequently, MTX228 has been identified as an activator of Lyn kinase and was considered as a treatment for type 2 diabetes as an insulin sensitizer because of Lyn's interaction with insulin signaling molecules. More recently, Lyn has been identified as a critical regulator of beta-cell mass, with genetic and biochemical inactivation of Lyn provoking beta-cell death in isolated human islets and precipitated diabetes in mice, and activation of Lyn stimulating beta-cell survival and beta-cell proliferation. These findings strongly suggest that small molecule activators of Lyn, such as MTX228, could represent new therapeutic options to promote beta-cell regeneration in type 1 diabetes.\n\nMTX228 has not been testing in clinical studies in type 1 diabetes and the optimal dose to use is not clear from the clinical trial in type 2 diabetes, where lower doses (100 mg once or twice daily) were more effective than higher doses (200 mg once or twice daily). The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of different doses of MTX228 in order to determine the most effective dose to move forward in a subsequent phase 2b study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"100 mg QD","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be assigned to receive 3 months oral tablet administration of MTX228 at the 100mg QD dose","interventionNames":["Drug: MTX228","Device: DEXCOM G6"]},{"label":"100 mg BID","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be assigned to receive 3 months oral tablet administration of MTX228 at the 100mg BID dose","interventionNames":["Drug: MTX228","Device: DEXCOM G6"]},{"label":"200 mg QD","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be assigned to receive 3 months oral tablet administration of MTX228 at the 200mg BID dose","interventionNames":["Drug: MTX228","Device: DEXCOM G6"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"MTX228","description":"Tolimidone was developed as a treatment for gastric ulcers but did not advance beyond phase 2 clinical trials because of lack of efficacy.
