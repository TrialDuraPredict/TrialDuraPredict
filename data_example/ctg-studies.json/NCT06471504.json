We will recruit children from Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health clinics to determine whether these measures may help determine autism risk."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Autism"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Children Undergoing Developmental Evaluation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Children undergoing a standard of care developmental evaluation will be enrolled into the study.

Eye movements and pupil diameter will be collected while participants view a series of developmentally appropriate pictures and movies. The eye-tracker consists of two cameras; one that monitors eye movements and a second scene camera that monitors head movements, which permits eye tracking to take place without any equipment touching the child. Children will be asked to sit in highchair or on their caregiver's lap and will face a computer monitor. After a sticker is applied to the child's forehead and brief eye-movement calibration completed, next visual stimuli (i.e., pictures and videos) will be presented on a laptop computer monitor that is placed at approximately 60-80cm from the child. The eye tracking portion of the visit will last approximately 15 minutes or until the child is no longer able to attend to pictures/videos.","armGroupLabels":["Children Undergoing Developmental Evaluation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Agreement between eye-tracking biomarker score and diagnosis","description":"The composite eye-tracking biomarker score, a consolidated measure based on eye-tracking indices that predict autism outcome, will be compared to the categorical autism diagnosis (autism presence/absence). Clinical diagnosis is obtained based upon a standard clinical evaluation conducted by an expert clinical psychologist. The evaluation will include 1) a semi-structured caregiver(s) clinical interview to gather information about developmental history and autism symptoms and 2) a battery of standardized child clinical observational measures. The evaluation will be conducted over a one-time 2-hour clinical autism evaluation. Eye-tracking will be recorded immediately following the clinical evaluation for a period of up to 15 minutes.","timeFrame":"Day 1"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Young children ages 12-48 months scheduled for health care visits at Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health clinics (e.g., Pediatric Care Center clinics).\n* Children must have English- or Spanish-speaking caregivers.\n* Children must have a legal guardian that is able to provide consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Child is younger than 12 months or older than 48 months.\n* Child's caregiver(s) is not English- or Spanish-speaking.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"48 Months","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Rebecca McNally Keehn, PhD, HSPP","role":"CONTACT","phone":"317-278-3435","email":"mcnallyr@iu.edu"},{"name":"Angela R Paxton, BS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"317-278-3435","email":"arpaxton@iu.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Rebecca R McNally Keehn, PhD, HSPP","affiliation":"IU School of Medicine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Riley Hospital for Children","city":"Indianapolis","state":"Indiana","zip":"46202","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Rebeccca McNally Keehn, PhD, HSPP","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.76838,"lon":-86.15804}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001321","term":"Autistic Disorder"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000067877","term":"Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"id":"D000002659","term":"Child Development Disorders, Pervasive"},{"id":"D000065886","term":"Neurodevelopmental Disorders"},{"id":"D000001523","term":"Mental Disorders"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4623","name":"Autistic Disorder","asFound":"Autism","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M206","name":"Autism Spectrum Disorder","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5903","name":"Child Development Disorders, Pervasive","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5902","name":"Developmental Disabilities","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M30644","name":"Neurodevelopmental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14473","name":"Psychotic Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4815","name":"Mental Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
