Mechanisms may include affective processes, learning factors, cognitive factors, or other constructs that could influence treatment outcomes. The study team will conduct this research within the context of an effective online treatment for OCD called OCD-NET. OCD-NET is bibliotherapy with coaching and its content is reflective of standard care for OCD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OCD-NET Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive the OCD-NET intervention for up to 12 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: OCD-NET"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"OCD-NET","description":"OCD-NET is bibliotherapy with coaching and its content is reflective of standard care for OCD.
