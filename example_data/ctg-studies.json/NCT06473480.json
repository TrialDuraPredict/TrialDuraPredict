The aim of the study is to investigate whether adult inpatients in general surgical wards, who require blood glucose monitoring throughout the day due to diabetes mellitus or as a result of surgery, benefit from a continuous glucose monitoring system compared to traditional fingerstick glucose monitoring. The comparison is conducted to determine whether a continuous glucose monitoring system is superior to traditional fingerstick glucose monitoring in terms of better glucose level management, patient satisfaction and experience, nursing staff workload and management experience, as well as in preventing complications. Furthermore, the accuracy of blood glucose values for continuous blood glucose monitoring is compared to fingerstick glucose monitoring and blood samples. The study's hypothesis is that continuous glucose monitoring systems are accurate and usable for measuring glucose levels in patients in a surgical ward. This will result in better glycemic control, thereby reducing complications and shortening hospital stays. It will also improve experience and satisfaction for patients, and decrease workload while enhancing the experience for nursing staff.","detailedDescription":"Glucose control in surgical patients with diabetes is essential to prevent hyper- and hypoglycemia, which can lead to infections, poor surgical outcomes, prolonged hospital stays, and death. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among patients in Denmark in 2022 was 6.2%. The global incidence of diabetes is increasing, resulting in a rising number of patients requiring glucose control during admission to surgical wards.\n\nGlucose control through point-of-care fingerstick capillary glucose monitoring (FSGM) is standard in many hospitals. However, FSGM can be painful, disrupt sleep, and increase patients' postoperative stress. Additionally, it can be time-consuming and require up to two hours of work for nurses per patient daily. Consequently, maintaining timely and prescribed glucose monitoring can be challenging in busy surgical wards, leading to untreated hyper- and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, FSGM provides only a snapshot of glucose concentration and does not indicate whether glucose levels are stable, increasing, or decreasing.\n\nAn alternative to FSGM is continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), which measure glucose levels via a subcutaneous sensor every few minutes. CGMS is primarily used in ambulatory settings, and studies have reported improved regulation of glucose levels. In surgical and medical wards, several studies have confirmed the accuracy of CGMS compared to FSGM, with reported mean absolute relative differences ranging from 9.4 to 12.9, making CGMS suitable for surgical wards.\n\nOther studies on CGMS in surgical and medical wards have reported a decrease in mean glucose levels, increased detection of daytime hyperglycemia, and decreased occurrences of nocturnal and prolonged hypoglycemia compared to FSGM monitoring.\n\nSome studies have explored patients' perspectives on CGMS, mainly in everyday life and outpatient settings. One study showed that women with type 2 diabetes monitored their glucose levels more closely with CGMS and took more initiative to regulate food intake, activity, and stress levels, consistent with findings from a review of the same patient group using CGMS. In another study involving patients with type 2 diabetes aged 53-72 years, patients found the technology helpful in disease management but also considered it an unpleasant reminder of disease progression, and the sensor could cause discomfort.\n\nA few case reports have described nurses' experiences with CGMS in hospital wards with patients with type 1 diabetes. Nurses reported an increased workload because the device receiver next to the patient was difficult to hear, leading to more frequent patient observations than usual.\n\nIn summary, studies of CGMS have shown safety and benefits in ambulatory settings, but challenges and knowledge gaps in hospital wards remain. To date, no studies have compared glucose levels from CGMS with those from a laboratory plasma glucose analyzer as the reference.\n\nSeven substudies will be conducted:\n\nSubstudy 1 - Glucose levels and management for surgical patients in relation to hospitalization: Compares glucose levels and management using point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS during hospitalization and FSGM and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) up to three months after discharge.\n\nSubstudy 2 - Patient satisfaction with glucose monitoring and management in surgical wards: Compares patient satisfaction with glucose monitoring and management for surgical patients using point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS during hospitalization.\n\nSubstudy 3 - Nursing staff's glucose monitoring and management workload in the surgical ward: Compares the nursing staff's workload with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS for surgical patients.\n\nSubstudy 4 (qualitative study) - Patient experience of glucose monitoring and management in relation to hospitalization in surgical wards: Compares the patient experience with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS and glucose management during hospitalization in the surgical ward and compares the patient experience of FSGM with CGM after discharge.\n\nSubstudy 5 - Continuous glucose level for surgical patients during hospitalization in the surgical ward: Compares the continuous glucose levels when glucose monitoring and management are performed by point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS, respectively.\n\nSubstudy 6 - Accuracy of CGMS for surgical patients during hospitalization: Investigates the accuracy of CGMS by comparing CGMS data with FSGM and plasma glucose data.\n\nSubstudy 7 (qualitative study) - Nursing staff's experience with fingerstick monitoring and CGSM for surgical patients: Compares the nursing staff's experience with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS and glucose management for surgical patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Blood glucose monitoring","point-of-care fingerstick capillary glucose monitoring","continuous glucose monitoring system","Patient satisfaction","Patient experience","Nursing staff's workload","Nursing staff's experience"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"PERIOD 1: Fingerstick glucose monitoring = Standard care, 140 participants\n\n* Substudy 1-3: all participants\n* Substudy 4: 20 patients of the 140 participants\n\nPERIOD 2\\*: Fingerstick glucose monitoring = standard care + blinded sensor, 70 participants\n\n* Substudy 5\\*: all participants\n* Substudy 6\\*: all participants\n\nPERIOD 3: Continuous glucose monitoring system = study Intervention 140 participants\n\n* Substudy 1-3: all participants\n* Substudy 4: 20 participants of the 140 participants\n* Substudy 5\\*: 70 participants of the 140 participants\n* Substudy 7: 27 participants (surgical nursing staff,10 surgical nursing staff from Odense University Hospital, 10 surgical nursing staff from Zealand University Hospital Koege, and 7 specialized diabetes nurses from Odense University Hospital)\n\n  * Only conducted at Odense University Hospital","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":377,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"PERIOD 1: Fingerstick glucose monitoring = Standard care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects' blood glucose levels are monitored using point-of-care fingerstick capillary glucose monitoring (standard care). which is conducted by surgical ward nurses.
