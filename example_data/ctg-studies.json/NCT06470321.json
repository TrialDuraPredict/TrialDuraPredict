Participants will undergo assessments of emotion regulation, neural activity via quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), and stress responses before and during a 24-hour nicotine abstinence period. They will then participate in a computerized smoking cessation intervention, and their abstinence status will be monitored for 6 months.","detailedDescription":"The study will examine the unique and interactive effects of emotion regulation ability (a trait-like vulnerability factor) and biomarkers of stress responses (emotion regulation and neural activation changes) prior to smoking cessation, on cravings, abstinence adherence, and response to a smoking cessation intervention.\n\nThe study will be divided into three main phases:\n\n* Ad libitum nicotine use (Day 1): Participants will smoke as usual. Baseline assessments of emotion regulation (heart rate variability), neural activity (qEEG), stress responses (salivary cortisol), and nicotine craving will be conducted before and after exposure to a stress task.\n* Acute 24-hour abstinence (Day 2): Participants will abstain from smoking for 24 hours. Emotion regulation, neural activity, withdrawal symptoms, and cue-induced cravings will be assessed.\n* Smoking cessation intervention (Days 3 to 180): Participants will engage in a computerized smoking cessation program. Abstinence will be biochemically verified at 3 and 6 months post-quit. Smoking lapses and time to relapse will also be monitored.\n\nThe primary outcomes are maintenance of abstinence, smoking lapses, and time to relapse. Secondary outcomes include changes in emotion regulation, neural activity, stress responses, withdrawal symptoms, and cue-induced cravings.\n\nThe study hypothesizes that smokers who fail to maintain long-term abstinence will exhibit enhanced stress-induced high-frequency qEEG oscillations, disrupted connectivity in emotion regulation brain regions, and emotion regulation deficits. It is also hypothesized that the interplay between these measures will predict smoking cessation outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Smoking","Smoking Cessation","Nicotine Addiction","Tobacco Smoking Behavior"],"keywords":["Nicotine","Relapse","Vulnerability","Biomarkers","EEG","HRV","Stress Reactivity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment This is a single-arm study where all participants will receive the same smoking cessation intervention after completing the initial assessments.","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maintenance of Abstinence","description":"Defined as biochemically verified (via expired carbon monoxide) continuous abstinence from smoking for the full 6 month period after the quit date","timeFrame":"Measured at 3 and 6 month follow-ups"},{"measure":"Time to First Smoking Lapse","description":"Defined as the number of days between the quit date and the first smoking lapse (smoking even a puff of a cigarette).
