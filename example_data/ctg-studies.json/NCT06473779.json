Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study involving an IMP.\n\n    Diagnostic Assessments\n20. Any clinically meaningful abnormal finding in physical examination, haematology, clinical chemistry at Visit 1 which, in the opinion of the investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of the study.\n21. Evidence of active liver disease, including jaundice or AST, ALT, or ALP \\> 2 times the ULN at Visit 1.\n22. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody serology at screening, or a positive medical history for hepatitis B or C. Patients with a history of hepatitis B vaccination without a history of hepatitis B are allowed to participate.\n\n    Other Exclusions\n23. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to AstraZeneca staff and/or site staff), or patients employed by or relatives of the employees of the site or AstraZeneca.\n24. Judgement by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.\n25. For women only: Pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating women. A serum β-HCG pregnancy test must be drawn for WOCBP at the screening visit. If the results of the serum β-HCG cannot be obtained prior to dosing of the IMP, a patient may be enrolled on the basis of a negative urine pregnancy test, though serum β-HCG must still be obtained. If either test is positive, the patient should be excluded. Since urine and serum tests may miss a pregnancy in the first days after conception, relevant menstrual history and sexual history, including methods of contraception, should be considered. Any patient whose menstrual and/or sexual history suggests the possibility of early pregnancy should be excluded.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"AstraZeneca Clinical Study Information Center","role":"CONTACT","phone":"1-877-240-9479","email":"information.center@astrazeneca.com"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"YES","description":"Qualified researchers can request access to anonymized individual patient-level data from AstraZeneca group of companies sponsored clinical trials via the request portal Vivli.org.
