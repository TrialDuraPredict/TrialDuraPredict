Side-to-side anastomoses are currently created by sutures, staples, and anastomotic compression devices. The most common side-to-side anastomosis technique used today is stapling, requiring cutting of the intestines and staples remain behind in the body. Linear staplers are available in different sizes (e.g., 30mm, 45mm, 50mm, 60mm). A predicate for this side-to-side duodeno-ileostomy diversion procedure is the single-anastomosis duodeno-ileostomy (SADI) procedure."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity","Type 2 Diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This is an open-label multicenter study enrolling up to 30 participants at up to 3 sites in Australia.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Magnet System, DI Biofragmentable","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"GT Metabolic Solutions Magnet System, DI Biofragmentable (MagDI System)","interventionNames":["Device: Magnet System, DI Biofragmentable"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Magnet System, DI Biofragmentable","description":"Anastomoses achieved by magnetic compression.","armGroupLabels":["Magnet System, DI Biofragmentable"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility and performance of the side-to-side anastomosis for duodeno-ileal diversion using the MagDI System.","description":"The duodeno-ileal diversion will be considered feasible if it results in successful:\n\n* Placement of the Magnet System (≥ 90% alignment of magnets); and\n* Creation of a patent anastomosis confirmed radiologically, and\n* Passage of magnets without any surgical re-interventions.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be met if the feasibility/performance is confirmed in ≥ 80% of enrolled and treated subjects.","timeFrame":"From date of study index procedure through 90 days"},{"measure":"Safety of the MagDI System","description":"Freedom from serious adverse events related to the study device or study device procedure requiring additional emergency surgery or re-intervention, including:\n\n* All-cause mortality\n* Intestinal perforation and/or peritonitis\n* Intestinal obstruction\n* Life-threatening bleeding\n* Incidence of device malfunctions","timeFrame":"Procedure, Day 90, Day 180, Day 360"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Between 18-65 years of age, at the time of informed consent.\n2. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 30-50 kg/m2\n3. Meets one of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM; defined as HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) or weight regain following previous sleeve gastrectomy (≥ 12 months); OR\n   2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM; defined as HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) without previous sleeve gastrectomy and without plan to perform a concurrent sleeve gastrectomy.\n4. Participant agrees to refrain from any type of additional bariatric or reconstructive surgery that would affect body weight for the duration of the study.\n5. Participant has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions, complying with study required testing, medications, follow-up visits, and has provided written informed consent.\n6. Participant is indicated for, and has agreed to, a bariatric procedure involving a duodenal ileal anastomosis. The participant has also undergone the site standard of care evaluation for this type of procedure, which is expected to involve clinical assessments over a period of time by a multidisciplinary team and may include, but is not limited to, the following: screening for surgical safety, interviews to determine if the participant understands the procedure and post-operative demands, and whether the participant has the necessary social supports in place to help manage outcomes.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Type 1 diabetes.\n2. Use of injectable insulin.\n3. Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).\n4.

Any comorbidity or current status of participant's physiological fitness that in the surgeon's or anesthesiologist's opinion represents safety concerns that make the participant medically unfit for the procedure, including any significant congenital or acquired anomalies of the GI tract at or distal to the placement of the Magnets.\n20. Unhealed ulcers, bleeding lesions, tumor, or any other lesion at target Magnet deployment site.\n21. Expected need for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) within the first 2 months post-procedure.\n22. Any surgical or interventional procedure (including planned and/or scheduled) within the period of 30 days prior to and 30 days following the study procedure.\n23.
