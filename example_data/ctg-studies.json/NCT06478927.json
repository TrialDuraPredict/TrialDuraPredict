Palbociclib is the world's first marketed inhibitor of the cell cycle protein-dependent kinase CDK4/6, which is capable of blocking cell cycle progression and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. However, current evidence for the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma cells remains lacking. This study used palbociclib backline treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, aiming to further validate the potential role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","detailedDescription":"This study was a single arm, prospective, open clinical study. Twenty-two patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled in this study and were simultaneously treated and observed with palbociclib. The efficacy and safety of palbociclib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated by PFS, ORR, DCR, OS, and AE."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hepatocellular Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Palbociclib Capsules","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Palbociclib Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Palbociclib capsules, oral, qd","interventionNames":["Drug: Palbociclib capsules"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Palbociclib capsules","description":"Palbociclib capsules, oral, 125 mg/dose, qd, take 3 weeks and then stop for 1 week, 28d for one treatment cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.","armGroupLabels":["Palbociclib Group"],"otherNames":["Palbociclib"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free survival (PFS)","description":"PFS is defned as the time from randomization untlthe date of first occurence of investigator assessed radiolbgical disease progression or death due to any cause,whichever came first.","timeFrame":"up to approximately 2 years."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective response rate (ORR)","description":"ORR is defied as the percentage of subject with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by investigator assessment per REclsT criteria, version 1.1.","timeFrame":"up to approximately 2 years."},{"measure":"Disease control rate (DCR)","description":"DCR was defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD).","timeFrame":"up to approximately 2 years."},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.","timeFrame":"up to approximately 2 years."},{"measure":"Adverse Events (AE)","description":"AE assessed by NCI-CTCAE V5.0.","timeFrame":"up to approximately 2 years."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
