Patients will receive Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab treatment for one cycle, followed by sequential short-course radiotherapy and then Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab treatment. If feasible, radical surgery will be performed to assess efficacy. A total of 8 cycles of chemotherapy will be administered, followed by Cadonilimab maintenance for up to 1 year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Locally Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Cadonilimab","Drug: Gemcitabine","Drug: Nab paclitaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cadonilimab","description":"10mg/kg，IV，D1，Q3W","armGroupLabels":["Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Gemcitabine","description":"1000mg/m2，IV，D1、D8、D15，Q4W","armGroupLabels":["Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nab paclitaxel","description":"125mg/m2，IV，D1、D8、D15，Q4W","armGroupLabels":["Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical benefit rate (CBR, CR+PR+SD)","description":"Clinical benefit rate ( complete response and partial response and stable disease)","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ORR","description":"overall response rate","timeFrame":"1 yaear"},{"measure":"PCR","description":"Complete pathological response rate","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"(EFS)RECIST 1.1","description":"event free survival","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"OS","description":"Overall survival .OS is defined as the time from date of neoadjuvant treatment start to the date of death from any cause or to the date of last follow-up if patients are alive.
