It is performed to diagnose and treat sympathetically maintained pain in phantom limb pain or complex reginal pain syndrome patient. The temperature of the affected arm is often lower than that of the opposite side. As a result of the procedure, the patient may experience sympathetic pain relief, such as coldness, stinging, numbness of the upper extremity. If the procedure does not last long, repetitive block or chemical neurolysis or radiofrequency thermocoagulation for the sympathetic ganglion is performed.\n\nHowever, even though in rare cases, chemical neurolysis is known to cause permanent plexus injury radiofrequency thermocoagulation is known to be less successful than chemical neurolysis because it is difficult to identify and stimulate the exact location of the ganglion. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a benefit to the patients if there is a procedure with long-lasting and avoiding injury.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that botulinum toxin (BTX) has been successfully used for the treatment of pain disorders. BTX plays a role with blocking the secretion of acetylcholine from the cholinergic nerve endings. Therefore, the use of BTX is expected to prolong the effect of neural blockade because pre-ganglia sympathetic nerves are cholinergic. It is also known that the action of BTX is not permanent and BTX does not exhibit cytotoxicity or neurotoxicity. Therefore, Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) is recommended for the treatment of migraine, myofascial pain syndrome, and neuropathic pain accompanied by allodynia. This study would like show whether thoracic sympathetic ganglion block using BTA has a longer duration than conventional local anesthesia by using prospective randomized, double-blind, parallel group, and comparative clinical trials."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Complex Regional Pain Syndromes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":78,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Local anesthetics","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Total volume of 0.375% ropivacaine 3 mL will be injected in phase 2.","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin A"]},{"label":"Botulinum toxin A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Total volume of BTX-A 75U in normal saline 3ml will be injected in phase 2.","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin A"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum toxin A","description":"Patients were assigned 1:1 to a control group using only local anesthetics (Group A) and a BTX-A group (Group B).
