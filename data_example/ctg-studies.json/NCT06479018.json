BP classically manifests with tense blisters over urticarial plaques on the trunk and extremities accompanied by intense itches. However, BP is characterized by a large spectrum of clinical presentations allowing to distinguish between typical (with blisters) and atypical forms (non bullous, mucosal damage).\n\nHigh potency topical steroids and systemic steroids are the current first line intention treatments. While very efficient, these therapies are non-targeted and cause numerous side-effects, especially in these elderly patients that are the most affected. Furthermore, around 30% of BP patients will relapse during the first year of treatment when corticotherapy is decreased or stopped.\n\nThe investigators and others have highlighted the presence of Il-17 family belonging-inflammatory cytokines in BP patients. Their functions in the amplification of the inflammatory response and in the mechanisms of relapse have to be precisely determined in order to develop innovative therapeutic approaches and to move forwards precision medicine.","detailedDescription":"This is a pathophysiological study with prospective and monocentric inclusion.\n\n90 patients with bullous phemphigoid will be recruited from the department of dermatology at the Reims University Hospital.\n\nThe main objectives of this study are to identify the cellular and molecular actors of the IL-17B/IL-17RB axis at diagnosis in patients with bullous pemphigoid and to determine their functions in the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with BP at systemic and in situ levels.\n\nThe secondary aims of this research are:\n\n1. To confirm IL-17B concentrations in sera at diagnosis as predictive biomarker of BP outcome under local corticotherapy\n2. To study the expression kinetics of IL-17B and its receptor IL-17RB in BP patients under treatment\n3. To study the implication of IL-17B/IL-17RB axis in BP relapse\n4. To establish inflammatory cell composition profile in skin and blood issued from clinical variants of BP as well as from BP patients during the first year of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bullous Pemphigoid"],"keywords":["Bullous pemphigoid","IL-17 family","inflammatory
