color stability and clinical performance of glass ceramic sectional veneers compared to full laminate veneers There's two null hypotheses , the first is that there is no difference in the marginal adaptation of sectional and full glass ceramic laminate veneers.\n\nthe Second is that there is no apparent change in color stability and clinical performance of sectional and full glass ceramic laminate veneers.","detailedDescription":"Although seeking for more minimally invasive treatment modalities with the use of the new advancements in ceramics and adhesive materials, however there is insufficient clinical studies assessing the ultraconservative sectional veneers has been published although there are many published case reports proving their success .\n\nHence the aim of this study is to assess the sectional veneers compared to laminate veneer regarding marginal adaptation, color stability and clinical performance"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Spacing of Anterior
