However, traditional pulmonary function assessment methods have significant limitations, including long testing durations, difficulties in patient cooperation, high false-negative rates, and numerous contraindications. Thus, our study optimized the final model based on 1500 single inspiratory phase CTs by transferring model parameters trained on 500 dual-phase respiratory CTs, enhancing its predictive capabilities for pulmonary function. This adjustment suits real-world application demands, offering more convenient, comprehensive, and personalized preoperative pulmonary function assessment support.
