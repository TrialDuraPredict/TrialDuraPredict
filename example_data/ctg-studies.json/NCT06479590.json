Some studies used small sample size, limiting the ability to identify significant impacts or generalized findings to large population.","detailedDescription":"The proposed study suggests addressing these gaps by employing a large sample size, comprehensive outcome measurements, assessing tDCS impact on diabetes mellitus (DM) risk variables, and integrating ethical considerations into the research design and implementation. The study aims to fill existing gaps in knowledge about tDCS effects on blood glucose regulation and diabetic risk factors by conducting more robust research methodologies The effects of tDCS on addictive behavior and cerebral glucose metabolism in problematic online gamers were examined in a single-blinded RCT. Over a 4-weekperiod, participants received 12 sessions of either active or sham tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the active group, glucose metabolism was enhanced in certain brain regions, showing decreased addiction severity in both groups. As a result of these findings, it appears that prefrontal tDCS is capable of controlling gaming behaviors and enhancing cerebral glucose metabolism"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Glucose Metabolism Disorders"],"keywords":["tDCS","glucose uptake","healthy young"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"tDCS Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Other: Sham tDCS"]},{"label":"Sham Group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Device: tDCS","Other: Sham tDCS"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"tDCS","description":"The DCS electrode sheaths of 7x5 cm will be soaked with standard saline solution(NaCl 9%) and fixed by elastic bands. tDCS will deliver 20 min of anodal stimulation (1-2mA, fade in/out 8 sec)","armGroupLabels":["Sham Group","tDCS Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Sham tDCS","description":"sham-tDCS will be applied for 30 s to make it difficult for the individual to distinguish the placebo from a real tDCS application","armGroupLabels":["Sham Group","tDCS Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RBS","description":"Two hours after meal, peripheral venous blood samples are collected to check random blood glucose levels.
