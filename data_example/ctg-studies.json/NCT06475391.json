The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over type of study. What this means is that each participant in the study will complete two exercise sessions after ingesting either a placebo (dextrose - a sugar molecule) or the active ingredient \\[insert supplement\\] plus dextrose. Neither you nor the research assistant testing you on the exercise sessions will know which ingredient you are ingesting before each exercise trial (i.e., the double-blind portion of the study). We will also randomize the order of which supplement plus placebo or placebo alone you will ingest so neither you nor the research assistant testing will know this either. The cross-over part of the study is that you will complete 2 testing sessions to assess some physical performance variables (grip strength, jump height and power, and anaerobic energy system power output) with one-week of a wash-out period between them. This will allow us to compare the placebo session to the active nutritional supplement plus placebo condition to evaluate if the supplements improve exercise performance acutely.\n\nYou will also be asked to fill in a 24-hour food and fluid log for the period before your initial exercise test. Then you will be asked to repeat this food and fluid intake when completing the second session. No caffeine, alcohol, or vigorous exercise will be allowed for the 24-hours prior to each trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Skeletal Muscle","Human Performance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"L-arginine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will ingest 2 grams of L-arginine before completing three anaerobic exercise tasks (grip strength, vertical jump, and Wingate cycle ergometer test).","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: L-arginine"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will ingest 2 grams of placebo (dextrose) before completing three anaerobic exercise tasks (grip strength, vertical jump, and Wingate cycle ergometer test).","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"L-arginine","description":"2 grams iof L-arginine will be ingested before an acute testing bout of exercise tasks in 250 mL of cranberry juice.","armGroupLabels":["L-arginine"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Grip Strength","description":"Grip strength measurement in kilograms of force produced on a hand held dynamometer.","timeFrame":"5 minutes"},{"measure":"Counter movement vertical jump","description":"Counter movement vertical jump performance height in centimeters.","timeFrame":"3 minutes"},{"measure":"Wingate anaerobic cycle ergometer test","description":"Maximum pedaling power output for 30 seconds of all-out sprinting on a cycle ergometer.","timeFrame":"30 seconds"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Recreationally physically active individuals will be recruited for the study.
