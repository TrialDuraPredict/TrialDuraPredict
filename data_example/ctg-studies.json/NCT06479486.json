COPD affects the respiratory system and is progressive, which can result in a number of difficulties or impairments. ) Effect on Daily Activities, Work Limitations, Fatigue Muscle Weakness, Breathlessness and Reduced Exercise Capacity, and Impaired Quality of Life. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a comprehensive course that helps people with chronic respiratory illnesses, such as COPD, improve their overall health and quality of life. Clinimetric properties of four distinct tools designed for assessing performance-based physical functional outcomes following COPD patients surgery. 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT), 2 minute Walk test (2MWT), and Timed Up and GO (TUG), 30sec sit to stand test (30sec STS) will be assessed to determine any changes in their functionality test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"],"keywords":["Clinimetric properties, COPD, performance-based measures"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single Group Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Functionality Assessment","type":"OTHER","description":"Each participant will be provided with an informed consent form detailing the purpose of the study.
