Nutritional therapy for anorexia, which is a primary symptoms of cachexia, and medicatio therapy to improve appetite have limitations in effectively alleviating the overall symptoms of cachexia. Cachexia initially manifests with symptoms such as loss of appetite and weight loss, and gradually progresses skeletal muscle loss, eventually leading to systemic dysfunction. Consequently, there is a steady increase in the development of related treatments.\n\nSAT-003 provides various activities aimed at improving the symptoms of cancer cachexia, with the ultimate goal of resuming discontinued chemotherapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer Cachexia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SAT-003","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: SAT-003"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"SAT-003","description":"Device: SAT-003(Software) Using SAT-003 for 12 weeks","armGroupLabels":["SAT-003"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Karnofsky Performance Status","description":"The KPS assessment is a scale that evaluates the process of patient's recovery to daily life after treatment.
