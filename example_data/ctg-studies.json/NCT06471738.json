The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of zanubrutinib combined with venetoclax and Rituximab in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) .","detailedDescription":"Follicular lymphoma (FL)is the most common inert non Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Their natural courses are slow but highly variable. The standard first-line treatment of advanced FL is based on rituximab. Whether combined with chemotherapy or not, it can induce lasting remission, but it is usually incurable. Although the first-line immunochemotherapy regimen has high efficacy, it also has high toxicity. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is related to many side effects, including bone marrow suppression and immunosuppression, gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity, neurotoxicity and the occurrence of secondary tumors. About 20% of FL patients relapse within 2 years after first-line chemotherapy. The overall prognosis of these patients is poor. This clinical trial aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of free-chemotherapy regimen (zanubrutinib combined with venetoclax and Rituximab) in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ann Arbor Stage II Follicular Lymphoma","Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage III Follicular Lymphoma","Ann Arbor Stage IV Follicular Lymphoma","Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma","Grade 3a Follicular Lymphoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (zanubrutinib, venetoclax, rituximab)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"stage I: zanubrutinib PO 160mg, BID rituximab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1,day 1 of cycle 2-3\n\nstage II: if complete response : zanubrutinib PO160mg BID rituximab IV on day 1 of cycles 4-9\n\nif no complete response : zanubrutinib PO160mg BID rituximab IV on day 1 of cycles 4-9 and Venetoclax PO (100mg D1, 200mg D2, and 400mg D3 of cycle4. 400mg d4 of cycle 4-9","interventionNames":["Drug: Zanubrutinib","Biological: Rituximab","Drug: Venetoclax"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Zanubrutinib","description":"BTK inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (zanubrutinib, venetoclax, rituximab)"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Rituximab","description":"Monoclonal antibody to CD20","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (zanubrutinib, venetoclax, rituximab)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Venetoclax","description":"BCL-2 inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (zanubrutinib, venetoclax, rituximab)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"CR rate","description":"Determined by PET/CT based on Cheson, Lugano classification 2014 as assessed by the investigator.
