It first investigates the application of pose estimating technologies to objectively measure posture.","detailedDescription":"This can entail capturing a patient's body position with cameras or other sensors in order to detect any imbalances or variations from normal posture brought on by the stroke. The study also looks at how well dynamic core postural chain stabilization (DCS) methods work for stroke recovery. The goal of DCS exercises is to increase stability and strength in the core, which can help with general postural control. This research aims to optimize stroke patient rehabilitation by combining a precise evaluation approach with a focused intervention strategy, which may result in improved balance, movement, and functional abilities."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Group A"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Group B"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Group A","description":"Group A was treated with Ibuprofen Dosage After breakfast and after dinner for 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Group A"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Group B","description":"Group B was treated with physical therapy; (Upper limb: The stroke patient warmed up with some gentle stretches for the wrist and fingers to get the muscles ready. They subsequently engaged in resistance training using dumbbells or resistance bands to increase the strength of their upper limbs. Bicep curls, tricep extensions, and shoulder presses were some of these exercises. They tried to complete two to three sets of ten to fifteen repetitions for each exercise, progressively increasing the resistance as their strength increased. Then, to improve dexterity and coordination in daily tasks, functional exercises were included.","armGroupLabels":["Group B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Berg Balance Scale","description":"For evaluating balance in a variety of functional tasks, the BBS is a commonly used and validated test. After the intervention period, the BBS scores of the control group and the intervention group (who received DCS techniques) can be compared. The efficacy of DCS in enhancing postural control would be strongly supported by a statistically significant increase in the intervention group's BBS score.","timeFrame":"12 Months"},{"measure":"Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) Score","description":"The total score for TIS ranges between 0 for a minimal performance to 23 for a perfect performance.
