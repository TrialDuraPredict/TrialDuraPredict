Guidelines on syncope recommend to apply guideline based syncope algorithm (SA) to identify low- / intermediate risk syncope patients and recommend to discharge these patients. The time window when to discharge these patients is not defined in the guidelines. In current medical practice low- / intermediate risk syncope patients are either immediately discharged or discharged after 24-hour observation with telemetry (TM). There seems to be an equipoise for both treatment strategies in current medical practice for these low risk syncope patients. A randomized controlled trial to compare discharge after 24 hour observation including TM with immediate discharge has never been done on the Cardiac Emergency Room (CER).","detailedDescription":"The diagnosis of syncope is a worldwide clinical dilemma. Appropriate identification of low risk vs high risk will reduce inappropriate admission for 24-hour observation with TM. The Dutch Geriatrics Society prioritized syncope management on its research agenda. This project is endorsed by the Dutch Societies of Neurology, Cardiology, Geriatrics, and Internal Medicine and results in freely accessible tutorials on an educational website: www.syncopedia.org.\n\nA randomized clinical trial that includes guideline based SA as routine medical care in the setting of a cardiac emergency room, that compares discharge after 24-hour observation with TM (reference treatment strategy) and immediate discharge (investigational treatment strategy) for low- and intermediate syncope patients will provide new insights and improve syncope health care for these patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Syncope"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Month","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":640,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"discharge","description":"immediate discharge with ambulant HR monitoring (investigational treatment strategy) in low- and intermediate syncope patients in the setting of cardiac emergency room","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: holter"]},{"label":"admission for 24 hours with rhythmobservation","description":"discharge after 24-hour telemetric-observation (reference treatment strategy) in low- and intermediate syncope patients in the setting of cardiac emergency room","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: holter"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"holter","description":"ambulant heart rate monitor (holter) for 24 hour.","armGroupLabels":["admission for 24 hours with rhythmobservation","discharge"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of Supraventricular tachycardia:","description":"a) Any atrial tachycardia (sustained or non-sustained â‰¥ 3 consecutive complexes) b) Atrio-Ventricular Nodal Re-entry Tachycardia (AVNRT) or Atrioventricular Re-Entry Tachycardia (AVRT) c) Premature Atrial Complex (PAC): \\>2 doublets or \\>2 episodes of 3 seconds duration of bi- or trigeminy d) Atrial Fibrillation de novo","timeFrame":"24 hour after randomization"},{"measure":"Incidence of Ventricular tachycardia:","description":"a) Any Ventricular Tachycardia (sustained/non sustained) b) Ventricular Fibrillation c) Premature Ventricular Complexes: \\>2 doublets or \\>2 episodes of 3 seconds duration of bi- or trigemini","timeFrame":"24 hour after randomization"},{"measure":"Incidence of Conduction disorders:","description":"a) Asystole \\>3sec (including conversion pauses) b) New first degree AV block with PQ\\>300 msec c) Progression first degree AV block with 15% c) 2nd degree AV block Mobitz type I and II d) 3rd degree AV block e) Any SA block","timeFrame":"24 hour after randomization"},{"measure":"Incidence of Other events","description":"a) Syncope recurrence b) Unexplained fall with injury c) All cause death d) Cardiovascular death","timeFrame":"24 hour after randomization"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Comparison of Syncope related healthcare costs","description":"Health care costs will be calculated on the basis of the tariffs set by the schedule of the Dutch National Health Service.","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Hospital utilization and duration of total in-hospital stay for both arms","description":"Hospital utilization of both treatment strategies will be quantified by the duration of the in-hospital stay from the moment of randomization.","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Proportion of additional diagnoses after both treatment strategies","description":"The analysis will be conducted at the major group level, i.e. (1) reflex syncope, (2) orthostatic hypotension, (3) cardiac syncope.
