A second expected benefit for the child, thanks to the work carried out in rehabilitation sessions on objectives adapted to his or her needs and day-to-day life, encouraging commitment and motivation, would be to improve the effectiveness of the care offered to him or her, thereby enhancing autonomy and physical health. For parents, taking part in goal-setting, by contributing their knowledge of their child and his or her daily life, would increase their involvement in their child's care and improve their satisfaction with the care offered. By setting SMART functional goals and facilitating communication between therapist, child and family, we expect to see a more child- and family-centred approach to care.\n\nOn a collective level, the \"Kid'EM app\" proposal would, as recommended by the WHO, improve professional rehabilitation practices and facilitate convergence towards good clinical practices for professionals (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, PRMs, etc.), thereby increasing the efficiency of the child rehabilitation care system.\n\nIf its value is demonstrated, the Kid'EM app could be adapted for children with other chronic illnesses requiring non-motor rehabilitation follow-up. The digitization of this goal-setting tool means that this low-cost practice could be widely disseminated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Children With Chronic Illnesses Affecting Physical Health"],"keywords":["Chronic disease","Children"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"\"Kid'EM app\" experimental group\n\nRehabilitation professionals have access to the Kid'EM app tool, which guides them in setting goals.\n\nThe app offers functionalities, including the selection of avatars by children, the identification of children's tastes and needs, the definition of SMART objectives, and the setting up of exchange spaces with parents and other professionals.\n\nThe application enables the identification of environmental elements that may impact on the child's progress, and provides a note-taking space for the professional.\n\nKidem app control group\n\nRehabilitation professionals have access to a control application which has the same design, but does not offer guidance or a space for exchange with parents.\n\nThe functionalities of the control application include the creation of the professional's account, selecting the child's pathology, identifying the child's tastes, and entering objectives without guidance.\n\nProfessionals use their usual strategy to set goals.\"","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The process of setting rehabilitation goals with \"Kid'EM app\" requires collaboration between the professional, the child and the family, preventing rehabilitation professionals and children and their families from being blindsided."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":252,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Kid'EM app\" experimental group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group uses the Kid'EM app, which guides rehabilitation professionals in setting goals for each child.
