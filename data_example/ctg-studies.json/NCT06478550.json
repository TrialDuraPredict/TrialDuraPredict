Participants will already be prescribed with Ozempic® by the study doctor. Participants may be asked to use a device called Mallya®, which participants must attach to their Ozempic® injection pen. Participants might also be asked to install an Ozempic® app on their mobile phone which supports the participants in the use of Ozempic®. At the beginning and at the end of this study, the participants will have to fill out some questionnaires about their diabetes treatment. Participants may also be chosen to participate in a voluntary non-mandatory interview after the study has ended. The total duration of study is approximately 10 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":304,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient Support Solution (PSS) app with connectivity to Mallya","description":"Participants will be treated with commercially available semaglutide subcutaneously (s.c.) according to routine clinical practice and local label at the discretion of the Health Care Providers (HCP) and receive PSS app with connectivity to Mallya device.","interventionNames":["Drug: Semaglutide"]},{"label":"PSS app without connectivity to Mallya","description":"Participants will be treated with commercially available semaglutide s.c. according to routine clinical practice and local label at the discretion of the HCP and receive PSS app without connectivity to Mallya device.","interventionNames":["Drug: Semaglutide"]},{"label":"Mallya","description":"Participants will be treated with commercially available semaglutide s.c. according to routine clinical practice and local label at the discretion of the HCP and use only Mallya device without PSS app.","interventionNames":["Drug: Semaglutide"]},{"label":"No intervention (Control arm)","description":"Participants will be treated with commercially available semaglutide s.c. according to routine clinical practice and local label at the discretion of the HCP and will not receive PSS app or Mallya device.","interventionNames":["Drug: Semaglutide"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Semaglutide","description":"Participants will be treated with commercially available semaglutide subcutaneously (s.c.) according to routine clinical practice and according to local label at the discretion of the Health Care Providers (HCP).
