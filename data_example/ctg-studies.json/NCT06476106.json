If successful, future studies may be done to implement these as a CM to SANS. To support this effort, participants will participate in 2 preflight study sessions consisting of a VTC fit check and a baseline data collection without and with the VTC donned. Participants will also participate in 3 inflight study sessions: a VTC fit check on flight day 30 (FD30) and two separate data collection sessions on flight day 45 (FD45) and 45 days before landing (R-45). During the two in-flight data collection days, participants will be studied before and for up to 6 hours after donning the VTC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Flight Thigh Cuff Crew Participants","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will participate in 2 preflight study sessions consisting of a VTC fit check and a baseline data collection without and with the VTC donned.

It consists of wide straps and a buckle which allow it to be tightened, then velcro to secure the strap in the tightened position. There is also lacing that can be tightened for micro adjustments. Imbedded within the fabric strap is a bladder that is not used for increasing tightness but allows the pressure of the cuff to be measured and tracked.","armGroupLabels":["Flight Thigh Cuff Crew Participants"],"otherNames":["Thigh Cuff"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) area","description":"Measured using Ultrasound.","timeFrame":"Thigh Cuff Measures 90 days before mission, after 45 days in mission, and 45 days before return"},{"measure":"IJV pressure","description":"Measured using the VeinPres device during Ultrasound.","timeFrame":"Thigh Cuff Measures 90 days before mission, after 45 days in mission, and 45 days before return"},{"measure":"Intraocular Pressure (IOP)","description":"Measured using the Pneumatonometer.","timeFrame":"Thigh Cuff Measures 90 days before mission, after 45 days in mission, and 45 days before return"},{"measure":"stroke volume","description":"Measured from data collected during Ultrasound.","timeFrame":"Thigh Cuff Measures 90 days before mission, after 45 days in mission, and 45 days before return"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Astronauts participating in missions that are â‰¥2 months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Having known allergies to proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution precludes participation in this study\n* Use of ethinyl estradiol Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) pills precludes participation in this study\n* Having increased risk of venothromboembolism (VTE) based on preflight thrombosis/clotting related biomarkers precludes participation in this study","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Brandon R Macias, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"281-483-2026","email":"brandon.r.macias@nasa.gov"},{"name":"Lucinda M Yu, M.S.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(281) 244-8051","email":"Lucinda.m.yu@nasa.gov"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Brandon R Macias, PhD","affiliation":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Johnson Space Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Houston","state":"Texas","zip":"77058","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Brandon R Macias, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"281-483-2026","email":"brandon.r.macias@nasa.gov"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":29.76328,"lon":-95.36327}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"}},"hasResults":false}
