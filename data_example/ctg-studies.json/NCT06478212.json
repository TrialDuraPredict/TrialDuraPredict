The study will begin as a Phase Ib study to determine the RCD and then will transition to a Phase II study to assess the clinical efficacy of vorasidenib at the RCD in combination with TMZ. During the treatment period participants will have study visits on day 1 and 22 of each cycle, with additional visits occurring during the first cycle of the Phase 1b study. Approximately 30 days after treatment has ended, a safety follow-up visit will occur and then participants will be followed for survival every 3 months. Study visits may include questionnaires, blood tests, ECG, vital signs, and a physical examination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["IDH1-mutant Glioma","IDH2-mutant Glioma"],"keywords":["IDH-mutant glioma","IDH mutation","vorasidenib","S95032","Phase 1/2","pediatric"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1b: Vorasidenib and Temozolomide (TMZ)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Vorasidenib","Drug: Temozolomide (TMZ)"]},{"label":"Phase 2: Vorasidenib recommended combination dose (RCD) and Temozolomide (TMZ)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Vorasidenib","Drug: Temozolomide (TMZ)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vorasidenib","description":"To be taken by mouth once daily in 28-day cycles with no break between cycles","armGroupLabels":["Phase 1b: Vorasidenib and Temozolomide (TMZ)","Phase 2: Vorasidenib recommended combination dose (RCD) and Temozolomide (TMZ)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Temozolomide (TMZ)","description":"To be taken by mouth once daily for the first 5 days of each 28-day cycle, for a maximum of 12 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Phase 1b: Vorasidenib and Temozolomide (TMZ)","Phase 2: Vorasidenib recommended combination dose (RCD) and Temozolomide (TMZ)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Phase 1b ONLY: Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)","timeFrame":"Through cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Number and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs of special interest (AESIs)","timeFrame":"Through 30 days after the end of treatment (Approximately 3 years)"},{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) status at 12 months","timeFrame":"12 months after treatment initiation"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"PFS","timeFrame":"Through study completion (Approximately 3 years)"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Through study completion (Approximately 3 years)"},{"measure":"Objective response rate (ORR)","timeFrame":"Through study completion (Approximately 3 years)"},{"measure":"Clinical benefit rate (CBR) (CR+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD])","timeFrame":"Through study completion (Approximately 3 years)"},{"measure":"Plasma concentration of vorasidenib and its metabolite AGI-69460","timeFrame":"Through cycle 13 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Phase 1b ONLY: Plasma concentration of TMZ","timeFrame":"Through cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Area under the curve (AUC) of vorasidenib and its metabolite AGI-69460","timeFrame":"Through cycle 13 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of vorasidenib and its metabolite AGI-69460","timeFrame":"Through cycle 13 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Maximum concentration (Cmax) of vorasidenib and its metabolite AGI-69460","timeFrame":"Through cycle 13 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Trough concentration (Ctrough) of vorasidenib and its metabolite AGI-69460","timeFrame":"Through cycle 13 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Phase 1b ONLY: Area under the curve (AUC) of TMZ","timeFrame":"Through cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Phase 1b ONLY: Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of TMZ","timeFrame":"Through cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Phase 1b ONLY: Maximum concentration (Cmax) of TMZ","timeFrame":"Through cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)"},{"measure":"Phase 1b ONLY: Trough concentration (Ctrough) of TMZ","timeFrame":"Through cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Be ≥12 years of age with a weight at screening ≥40 kg.\n* Have documented IDH1 or IDH2 mutation based on local testing of tumor tissue by an accredited laboratory\n* Have adequate renal function, defined as a creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation: (140 - Age) × (Weight in kg) × (0.85 if female) / 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL).\n* Have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by:\n\n  1.
