Diagnosis of EPI is measured by a fecal elastase value of \\<200, and patients must have a qualifying symptom burden based on the EPI symptom tracker survey. Blood and stool will be analyzed as part of this study, and other surveys of health status will be used to track improvement of symptoms.","detailedDescription":"This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of pancrelipase (CREON) in eligible outpatient adults following an episode of acute pancreatitis. Following study eligibility evaluation and informed consent, patients will complete a 7-day run-in period without any pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and complete baseline questionnaires and assessments, followed by a 180-day treatment period with pancrelipase. The study will end after a final 30 day-post pancrelipase treatment observation period during which safety events will be collected, and EPI symptom burden as well as stool frequency and consistency will be assessed as primary outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pancrelipase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pancrelipase (CREON) capsules taken orally with food, at a dose 36,000 units with snacks and 72,000 units with meals, for a total of 6 months (180 days)","interventionNames":["Drug: Pancrelipase Capsules"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pancrelipase Capsules","description":"Treatment with Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Pancrelipase"],"otherNames":["CREON"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient-Reported EPI Symptoms - Short Term","description":"Determine the patient-reported change in total Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) symptom score as measured by the EPI Symptom Tracker from baseline to 30 days of pancrelipase treatment; scored from 0 - 3, 0 being no symptoms and 3 being worst possible symptoms.","timeFrame":"30 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient-Reported EPI Symptoms - LongTerm","description":"Determine the patient-reported change in total Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI)symptom score as measured by the EPI Symptom Tracker from baseline to the end of pancrelipase treatment (180 days); scored from 0 - 3, 0 being no symptoms and 3 being worst possible symptoms.","timeFrame":"180 days"},{"measure":"Change in Stool Frequency","description":"Record changes in stool frequency from baseline to 30 days and from baseline to the end of pancrelipase treatment (180 days)","timeFrame":"180 days"},{"measure":"Change in Stool Consistency","description":"Record change in stool consistency from baseline to 30 days and from baseline to the end of pancrelipase treatment","timeFrame":"180 days"},{"measure":"Change in Depression Score","description":"Change in depression score assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) from baseline to 30 days and from baseline to end of pancrelipase treatment; scores range from 0 - 27, with a higher score meaning worse depression symptoms","timeFrame":"180 days"},{"measure":"Change in SF-12 Health Score","description":"Change in self-assessment of health status as assessed by the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) from baseline to 30 days and from baseline to end of pancrelipase treatment (180 days); form is not numerically scored","timeFrame":"180 days"},{"measure":"Change in Global Health Score","description":"Change in Global Health score assessed by the Global Health (PROMIS) Questionnaire.
