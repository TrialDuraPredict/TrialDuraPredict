Clinically, localized signs of inflammation limited to the gingiva, presence of significant bacterial plaque load, and stable attachment levels on the periodontium can be observed in course of gingivitis. The aim of the present study is to compare clinical aspects of gingival tissue in healthy patients versus patients with gingivitis to assess the ultrastructural variations present in course of inflammation.\n\nPatients with gingivitis and healthy controls will be enrolled. All patients will undergo ultra-high frequency ultrasonographic scans (70 MHz) of gingival tissue on three areas per dental arch (anterior, middle right, middle left). Gingival thickness, echogenicity, and vascularization assessed through resisitive index will be evaluated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gingivitis","Periodontitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gingivitis group","description":"patients affected by gingivitis","interventionNames":["Other: Performance of ultrasonographic scan"]},{"label":"Control group","description":"Periodontally healthy patients","interventionNames":["Other: Performance of ultrasonographic scan"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Performance of ultrasonographic scan","description":"Ultra-high frequency ultrasonographic scan of gingival tissues","armGroupLabels":["Control group","Gingivitis group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Echogenicity","description":"Variations in echogenicity assessed through grey levels distribution between healthy patients versus gingivitis","timeFrame":"measured once at enrollemnt"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Vascular parameters","description":"Variations in vascularization assessed through grey levels distribution between healthy patients versus gingivitis","timeFrame":"measured once at enrollemnt"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* males or females of age \\> 18 years\n* presence of at least 20 teeth\n* full-mouth plaque score (FMPS) \\>50%\n* FMBS \\>30%\n* ability and willingness to give informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnancy or breastfeeding\n* pharmacological treatment with antinflammatory drugs, statins, or either local or systemic antibiotics (within the previous 30 days)\n* smoking habit\n* dental or periodontal condition requiring immediate treatment\n* refusal to be enrolled in the study","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Consecutive patients referred to the Sub-Unit of Periodontology, Halitosis, and Periodontal Medicine of the Unit of Dentistry and Oral Surgery at the University Hospital of Pisa will be enrolled.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Rossana Izzetti","role":"CONTACT","phone":"3475205619","email":"rossana.izzetti@unipi.it"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Pisa","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Pisa","zip":"56126","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Rossana Izzetti","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39050993037","email":"rossana.izzetti@unipi.it"},{"name":"Rossana Izzetti","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":43.70853,"lon":10.4036}},{"facility":"Department of Surgical, Medical and Molecular Pathology and Critical Care Medicine, University Hospital of Pisa","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Pisa","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Rossana Izzetti","role":"CONTACT","phone":"3475205619","email":"rossana.izzetti@unipi.it"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":43.70853,"lon":10.4036}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000005891","term":"Gingivitis"},{"id":"D000010518","term":"Periodontitis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010510","term":"Periodontal Diseases"},{"id":"D000009059","term":"Mouth Diseases"},{"id":"D000009057","term":"Stomatognathic Diseases"},{"id":"D000007239","term":"Infections"},{"id":"D000005882","term":"Gingival Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13427","name":"Periodontitis","asFound":"Periodontitis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M9003","name":"Gingivitis","asFound":"Gingivitis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13419","name":"Periodontal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12019","name":"Mouth Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12017","name":"Stomatognathic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10283","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6368","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8994","name":"Gingival Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
