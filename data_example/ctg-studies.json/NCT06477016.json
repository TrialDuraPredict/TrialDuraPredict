The patient population will be randomly divided into two arms, with one receiving the OsciPulse System and the other receiving standard intermittent compression therapy.\n\nBoth arms will have the therapy applied within 24 hours of admission and continue during their hospital stay until day 7 or discharge, whichever is shorter, unless clinically required to be removed. Daily d-dimer levels will be assessed until day 7 or discharge. If required beyond day 7, standard compression therapy will be provided. An interim analysis will be performed after 20 subjects are enrolled to evaluate the speed of enrollment and data variability and quality. If indicated, enrollment will be increased up to 40."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Ischemic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"7 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A-OsciPulse System","description":"Patients admitted to the neuro intensive care unit or intermediate neurological care unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke randomly assigned to Group A.","interventionNames":["Device: OsciPulse"]},{"label":"Group B- Standard Reference Therapy","description":"Patients admitted to the neuro intensive care unit or intermediate neurological care unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke randomly assigned to Group B.","interventionNames":["Device: Intermittent Pneumatic Compression"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"OsciPulse","description":"Non-invasive device that provides rapid pulses of compression of the calves to modify venous blood flow patterns in immobilized persons.","armGroupLabels":["Group A-OsciPulse System"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Intermittent Pneumatic Compression","description":"Non-invasive device that provides rapid pulses of compression of the calves to modify venous blood flow patterns in immobilized persons.","armGroupLabels":["Group B- Standard Reference Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in serum d-dimer levels.","description":"Relative change in serum d-dimer levels for each subject from baseline to Day 7 or discharge","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Tolerability of the OsciPulse device in the stroke population","description":"Tolerability defined as the number of patients who stop using the device prior to clinical recommendation and by quantitative scoring of subject experience questionnaires.","timeFrame":"7 days"},{"measure":"Safety of the OsciPulse device in the stroke population","description":"Comparison of the rate of Adverse Events (AE) between the two groups.","timeFrame":"7 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
