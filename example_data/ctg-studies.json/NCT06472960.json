The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is there a correlation among the level of physical activity, performance in inhibitory control, and the diameter of retinal microvasculature, and do retinal microcirculation parameters mediate this relationship?\n2. Does short-term aerobic exercise (moderate and high intensity) improve inhibitory control and physiological markers, such as retinal diameter and frontal brain activation, compared to a sedentary control group?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cognition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Moderate-intensity cycling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Moderate-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Moderate-intensity cycling","Behavioral: Uninterrupted sitting"]},{"label":"Vigorous-intensity cycling","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vigorous-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Vigorous-intensity cycling","Behavioral: Uninterrupted sitting"]},{"label":"Uninterrupted sitting","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Uninterrupted sitting in a quiet room","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Uninterrupted sitting"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Moderate-intensity cycling","description":"Moderate-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","armGroupLabels":["Moderate-intensity cycling"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Vigorous-intensity cycling","description":"Vigorous-intensity cycling on Ergoline Ergoselect 100","armGroupLabels":["Vigorous-intensity cycling"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Uninterrupted sitting","description":"Uninterrupted sitting in a quiet room","armGroupLabels":["Moderate-intensity cycling","Uninterrupted sitting","Vigorous-intensity cycling"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cognitive function","description":"This primary outcome measure is assessed by the modified dual-task Stroop paradigm.","timeFrame":"21 weeks"},{"measure":"Retinal Vessel Diameter","description":"Retinal Vessel Diameter is assessed by the fully automated fundus camera.","timeFrame":"21 weeks"},{"measure":"Brain Connectivity","description":"Brain connectivity is assessed by the NIRSport2 device","timeFrame":"21 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* right-handed (how was handedness assessed; i.e., \"What hand do you write with?\") with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal color vision\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* reported a history of cardiovascular, metabolic, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, medical conditions requiring medical care, substance addiction, strict diets (e.g., low- carbohydrate and Mediterranean diet), pregnancy, or lactation.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"25 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Liye Zou, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"18823437684","email":"liyezou123@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Body-Brain-Mind Laboratory, School of Psychology, Shenzhen University","city":"Shenzhen","state":"Guangdong","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Liye Zou, Dr.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"18823437684","email":"liyezou123@gmail.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":22.54554,"lon":114.0683}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"}},"hasResults":false}
