Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been shown to reduce anxiety comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, anxiety-specific targets have received insufficient attention.\n\nAn anxiety specific transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) target was recently derived via causal network mapping and was shown to reduce anxiety versus depression symptoms to a greater extent than the conventional dlPFC target in an MDD sample with comorbid anxiety. While potentially promising, this target has yet to be trialed in an anxiety-related disorder sample.\n\nThe current open-label study will be the first to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and safety of this novel right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) TMS target. MRI-guided neuronavigation will be used to locate this target in each participant. An accelerated intermittent theta-burst (aiTBS) dosing regimen will be used. Based on a 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth), 50 sessions of iTBS will be administered (1800 pulses per session, with a 50-minute inter-session interval) and delivered in a schedule of 10 sessions per day for 5 consecutive days. Clinical assessments and resting-state functional MRI scans will be conducted before and after aiTBS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anxiety Symptoms","Anxiety Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Open-label aiTBS to novel right dmPFC TMS anxiety target","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"non-invasive form of brain stimulation accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS)","armGroupLabels":["Open-label aiTBS to novel right dmPFC TMS anxiety target"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Effectiveness as measured by Beck Anxiety Inventory","description":"Measure of severity of anxiety - total score of Beck Anxiety Inventory ranges from 0 to 63 (higher numbers indicate higher severity)","timeFrame":"Anxiety symptoms will be measured before the TMS treatment, immediately after 5 days of TMS, 1 week and 4 weeks respectively after completion of the TMS treatment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety as measured by number of participants with Adverse Events","description":"Count of Adverse Events Reported during follow up","timeFrame":"Each afternoon after treatment during the 5 days of treatment"},{"measure":"Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) scan","description":"Functional MRI scan will be conducted before and after treatment to assess for treatment-induced changes in brain connectivity","timeFrame":"Baseline (before treatment) and after 5 days of TMS stimulation"},{"measure":"Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA)","description":"Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56","timeFrame":"Baseline (before treatment), 5 days of TMS treatment, and 1 and 4 weeks after the end of the TMS stimulation"},{"measure":"State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)","description":"State and trait anxiety will be assessed separately with 20 respective questions.
