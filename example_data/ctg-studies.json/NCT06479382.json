The device is intended to treat subjects who suffer from eye pain an do not get relieve from current medications or clinical treatments. Thirty eyes will be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to the investigational treatment or a sham treatment. Improvement in self-reported ocular pain and clinical safety measures will be evaluated.\n\nIt is anticipated that the learnings from the study will be used to design future study of the ETX-4143 2.0 device.\n\nAll subjects will be followed for 8 weeks. Subjects will only have the worse eye treated if both eyes meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\nA medical monitor will evaluate the safety of the study on a continual basis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Eye Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Investigational","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Treatment with the ETX-4143 2.0 device","interventionNames":["Device: ETX-4143 2.0"]},{"label":"Control","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"Treatment with a sham ETX-4143 2.0 device","interventionNames":["Device: ETX-4143 2.0"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"ETX-4143 2.0","description":"Treatment of the eye with the ETX-4143 2.0 device","armGroupLabels":["Control","Investigational"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reduction of eye pain","description":"Patient reported level of eye pain","timeFrame":"Eight weeks"},{"measure":"Adverse events","description":"Adverse events related to treatment","timeFrame":"Eight weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Documented history of eye pain with no relief from currently available medications or treatments\n* Willing to forgo participation in any other clinical stud for the duration of this study\n* Demonstrate sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with the examination process\n* Willing and able to comply with the schedule for follow-up visits\n* Willing to participate in the study as evidenced by signing an informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study time period, including the follow-up period\n* Any active ocular infection or active ocular inflammation at the time of the screening visit\n* History of herpes keratitis, non-healing corneal epithelial defects, or neurotrophic keratopathy due to corneal herpetic disease, stem cell deficiency, diabetic keratopathy, severe lagophthalmos, or topical anesthetic abuse\n* Any history of significant eye surgery with the prior 90 days\n* Planned eye surgery during the entire study\n* Participation in any clinical study of an investigational product within 30 days prior to enrollment\n* Any history of serious, poorly controlled systemic or ophthalmic condition that could compromise the subject's ability to comply with the protocol or compromise their safety","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"22 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Patrick R Casey, OD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"5104100543","email":"patrick.casey@eyecooltx.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Patrick R Casey, OD","affiliation":"VP of Clinical Develpment","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000058447","term":"Eye Pain"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000005132","term":"Eye Manifestations"},{"id":"D000005128","term":"Eye Diseases"},{"id":"D000010146","term":"Pain"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13066","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M29070","name":"Eye Pain","asFound":"Eye Pain","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M8275","name":"Eye Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8271","name":"Eye Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12404","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC11","name":"Eye Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
