This condition can cause facial deformity, feeding problems, frequent middle ear infections, dental defects, speech abnormalities and emotional problems . Early surgical repair of this congenital anomaly prevents the psychological and functional problems associated with the deformity . Patients may develop various complications after primary palatoplasty including palatal fistula and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) which are relatively common .\n\nThe main goal of cleft palate repair is to achieve normal speech and adequate velopharyngeal function with minimal effect on facial growth. The primary objective in the surgical repair of a cleft palate is the development of normal speech. Speech quality remains the most important standard for assessing clinical outcomes and the success of surgical procedures. Many surgical techniques for palate correction have been described determining the most effective technique for the surgical repair of palatal clefts continues to cause controversy .\n\nThe incidence of VPI post cleft palate repair is 20-30% of patients . If there is significant velopharyngeal dysfunction during normal speech development, many children learn to compensate for the lack of intraoral pressure. They produce a hoarse voice because of vocal fold adduction and sudden release. Compared with the adductor vocal fold palsy ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cleft Palate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":".
