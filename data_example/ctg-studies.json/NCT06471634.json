The main questions it aims to answer are: • question 1, can objectively measured sleep and sedentary behaviour be improved in the participants and • question 2, what effect will this have on a number of physical and physiological markers. Participants in the intervention group will be asked to keep sleep diaries and attend regular meetings with a qualified coach who will use a specific talking therapy to try to improve sleep and with use behaviour change techniques to help them be less sedentary. Researchers will compare the control group to the intervention group to see if effects differ between groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Insomnia","Sedentary Behavior"],"keywords":["Sleep","Insomnia","Sedentary behaviour","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Cognitive Behaviour Therapy insomnia (CBTi)","Behaviour change"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"The technicians analysing the accelerometer data and blood analysis will be blinded as to which arm the participant is from, no other masking is possible.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CBTi and Sedentary Behaviour support","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will be counselled in how to improve their sleep and decrease sedentary behaviour using CBTi and behaviour change techniques.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: CBTi","Behavioral: Sedentary behaviour reduction"]},{"label":"Control - usual care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will be given a leaflet containing brief information on good sleep hygiene practice and the benefits of decreasing sedentary behaviour.","interventionNames":["Other: Control - usual care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"CBTi","description":"A 12 week intervention using CBTi to improve sleep measured using objective and subjective measures.
