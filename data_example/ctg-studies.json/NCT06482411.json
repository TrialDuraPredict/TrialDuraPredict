In addition to weight loss medications, many patients seek bariatric surgery to treat obesity. Although bariatric surgery was the most effective way, the patients still get weight gain due to failure to control their lives. The failure weight loss is caused by complex risk factors, such as dietary habits, quality of life, physical inactivity, comorbidities remission rate, and more related to the failure weight loss factors. To explore weight gain factors, the study uses many questionnaires, including demographic parameter and exercise frequency survey, the WHOQOL-BREF assessment, The Bariatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (BQL), the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18), the Yale Food Addiction Scale version 2.0 (YFAS 2.0), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). The investigators assess different factors like quality of life, food addiction, preferences, psychological status, and regular examination parameters to identify reasons for unsuccessful weight loss. The study aims to establish the model for the prediction of risk factors after treatment of weight loss so that the tools will help to manage the best weight control for the future.","detailedDescription":"Obesity is a disease worldwide. Hence, many patients seek many different treatments for obesity. The methods for obesity include medical and surgical treatment. The medicine treatment indication for diabetes previously increased indication to weight loss for obese patients now. Recently, the four approved weight loss medicines by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) include Orlistat, Liraglutide, Contrave, and Semaglutide. In addition to medications for weight loss, indications for more than 30 body mass index (BMI) and more than 27 BMI with uncontrol obesity-related comorbidities.\n\nAnother weight loss treatment was bariatric surgery. The surgical treatment focuses on morbidity obese patients. Decrease food intake and absorb calories by changing the structure of the stomach and intestine to weight loss and improve comorbidities. Moreover, three functions for bariatric surgery by different mechanisms to weight loss outcome, include (1) restriction, (2) malabsorption, (3) mixed function, and which indication for more than 37.5 BMI and more than 32.5 BMI with two or more uncontrol obesity-related comorbidities.\n\nSince obesity is not a condition that can be cured by surgical removal of lesions forever, patients often experience weight loss failure after receiving both medical and surgical treatments. Particularly, the probability of weight loss failure after medical treatment is higher than that after surgical treatment. Complexed risk factors caused failure weight loss from behavioral dietary, quality of life, remission rate of comorbidities, genetic inheritance, physical Inactivity, and psychological status. Moreover, failure weight loss has two definitions (1) weight regain (WR) and (2) insufficient weight loss (IWL). The investigators searched many studies to organize failure weight loss definitions referenced by Surgery for Obesity and Related Disease (SORD) in the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS). IWL is defined as less than 50 percent excess weight loss (%EWL) or less than 35 BMI after 18 months. WR is defined as (1) more than the nadir weight of 10 kg (2) more than the nadir weight of 25% EWL (3) more than the nadir weight of 5 BMI (4) successfully reduced to a BMI below 35, but after 1-year post-treatment, it exceeded BMI 35 (5) at any point within 1-year post-treatment, the weight is higher than the lowest weight achieved. (6) the weight regained is more than 15% of the lowest weight achieved. In contrast to weight gain after medicine which is defined by population proportion 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% statistical analysis.\n\nThe study was an observational cohort study. The investigators will use the six types of questionnaires (1) Demographic parameters and exercise frequency (2) WHOQOL-BREF scale (3) Bariatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (BQL) (4) Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18) (5) Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS)2.0 (6) Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). The investigators hypothesize that the above risk factors are significantly related to each other and failure to weight loss after bariatric surgery. The aims are to analyze the risk rate of weight regain by different weight loss treatments that can promote quality of weight management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Weight Regain"],"keywords":["Obesity","Weight regain","Bariatric surgery","Anti-obesity medications","Lifestyle intervention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":900,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Surgical group","description":"Bariatric surgery Participants underwent LSG, OAGB, SASI, and RYGB surgical treatment during the period from 2024 to 2028."},{"label":"Non-Surgical group","description":"Participants were treated with anti-obesity medications plus lifestyle intervention therapy Participants were treated with TFDA-approved anti-obesity medications (e.g. Saxenda, Contrave, etc.)."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The proportion of failure weight loss","description":"Compare the proportion of failure weight loss after bariatric surgery and medication plus life intervention at 1, 1.5, and 2 years.","timeFrame":"Month 6, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The percentage of total weight loss changes","description":"Change from Baseline in percentage of total weight loss","timeFrame":"Follow-up 8 times (Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2) visit for all secondary outcome"},{"measure":"Weight change","description":"Change from Baseline in weight change","timeFrame":"Follow-up 8 times (Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2) visit for all secondary outcome"},{"measure":"BMI change","description":"Change from BMI in weight change","timeFrame":"Follow-up 8 times (Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2) visit for all secondary outcome"},{"measure":"Exercise change","description":"Change from baseline in exercise frequency","timeFrame":"Follow-up 8 times (Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Year 1, Year 1.5, Year 2) visit for all secondary outcome"},{"measure":"Physiological parameter change","description":"Change from baseline in physiological parameter.\n\n1.
