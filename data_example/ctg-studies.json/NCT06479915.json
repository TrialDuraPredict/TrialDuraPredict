Recent studies have identified their role in the development of systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Streptococcus Mutans (SM) is considered the primary pathogen responsible for dental caries. Furthermore, in cases of oral inflammatory diseases, SM has been found to invade the bloodstream and disseminate, leading to systemic diseases. Against this backdrop, this study aims to investigate disparities in oral flora between stroke patients and healthy individuals by collecting saliva samples from both groups.","detailedDescription":"Oral bacteria constitute the second largest population of the human microbiome.
