These complications are associated with a decline in quality of life and increased mortality. The hypothesis of the study is to show that physical activity during the dialysis session in dialyzed patients has a benefit on quality of life, as well as on muscle, cardiovascular and dialysis parameters.","detailedDescription":"Dialysis patients have reduced aerobic capacity, walking ability, and an increased risk of hypertension. These complications are associated with a decline in quality of life and increased mortality.\n\nSince asthenia is too intense after the dialysis session, patients are encouraged to perform physical activity during dialysis sessions. Some studies have shown that physical activity during dialysis can have benefits on quality of life and improve muscle parameters, but without this being clinically significant. Other studies show no benefit. The objective of the study is to explore the benefits of physical activity on quality of life, muscle parameters, and biological and dialysis parameters in a cohort of compliant hemodialysis patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dialysis"],"keywords":["dialysis patients","physical activity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single group.
