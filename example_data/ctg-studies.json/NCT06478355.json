According to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year survival rates vary among patients at different stages of esophageal cancer: approximately 50% for early and mid-stage cases, around 26% for locally advanced cases, and only 5% for those with distant metastasis.In recent years, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has emerged as the first-line standard treatment for advanced esophageal cancer, and several phase III trials of immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy are currently underway for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Despite being a novel treatment strategy for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, there remains a lack of sufficient evidence-based medical data supporting the use of immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy.In recent years, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has emerged as the first-line standard treatment for advanced esophageal cancer, and several phase III trials of immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy are currently underway for locally advanced esophageal cancer.
