This will take place in rural Uganda and urban Kenya Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) and the study team will analyze its feasibility, impacts, cost through process, and economic evaluations. The study team will also assess the data quality and equity of the digital vaccine registry and card system.","detailedDescription":"This study design has three parts or aims for this project, however, only the third aim is considered to be the trial portion and is included in this registration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Vaccines"],"keywords":["Kenya","Uganda","Vaccine coverage","Vaccine completion","Vaccine timeliness","Digital health interventions"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Villages will be randomized to receive the digital vaccine card access with short message service (SMS) reminders versus the group of children whose village did not receive digital vaccine card access with SMS reminders (treatment/control).","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2700,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Next Generation digital vaccine card with SMS reminders for upcoming vaccination(s)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: SMS reminders for upcoming vaccination(s)"]},{"label":"Pre-intervention cohort","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"This group will be compared to the post-intervention group to assess the digital vaccine card."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"SMS reminders for upcoming vaccination(s)","description":"All parents/caregivers of children in participating villages will receive access to a digital vaccine card.
