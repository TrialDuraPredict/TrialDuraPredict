However, all previous studies excluded dialysis patients. Patients starting dialysis may still produce a certain amount of urine. Importantly, patients with better preserved residual kidney function tend to have better control of blood pressure and volume status, improved nutrition status, higher quality of life and reduced mortality rate.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of empagliflozin in patients on peritoneal dialysis, in preparation for a future large clinical trial. Participants who newly initiate peritoneal dialysis will be randomly allocated to either empagliflozin on top of standard of care, or standard of care alone. Over a follow-up period of six months, the investigators will collect information on urine volume, blood pressure and glucose control. Safety, tolerability and drug compliance of empagliflozin will also be evaluated. If empagliflozin is found to be safe and well tolerated in patients on peritoneal dialysis, further large-scale randomized controlled trial may be conducted to evaluate its impact on residual kidney function and other relevant clinical outcomes.","detailedDescription":"Diabetes is the leading cause of end stage kidney disease in developed countries. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home-based and cost-effective modality of kidney placement therapy. Maintenance of residual kidney function (RKF) is one of the most crucial objectives to improve outcomes of PD patients. Observational studies showed that residual urine volume or residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but not peritoneal creatinine clearance, independently predicted patient survival. This benefit is likely attributed to better volume control, improved nutritional status, preserved endocrine function and enhanced clearance of uremic toxins in the presence of RKF. However, current therapeutic strategies to preserve RKF were most limited to the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and biocompatible PD solutions.\n\nHong Kong adopted the 'PD-first' policy since 1985, and has the highest proportion of PD patients in the world. Inadequate dialysis, which is directly related to the loss of RKF, is the second most common reason for a permanent transfer to hemodialysis among PD patients. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria and delay progression of chronic kidney disease even in patients with advanced stages of kidney disease. It is postulated that the renoprotective effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors may be extended to dialysis population since a considerable proportion of patients still have urine output. SGLT2 inhibitors may potentially attenuate GFR decline in PD patients because heavy proteinuria independently predicted decline in residual GFR and onset of anuria. Moreover, preclinical studies suggested that empagliflozin reduced inflammation and oxidative stress by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines, inducing expression of anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages, and antagonizing the effect of advanced glycation products. This beneficial effect may be particularly relevant to PD patients, where subclinical inflammation is common and inversely correlated with RKF.\n\nDespite the potential promising effect of SGLT2-inhibitors in RKF in PD patients, dialysis patients were excluded in previous randomized controlled trials. In the present study, the investigators hypothesize that oral empagliflozin in addition to RAAS inhibitor, compared to RAAS inhibitor alone, better preserves RKF in patients newly started on PD. After a run-in period of 6 to 8 weeks where the dose of RAAS inhibitors are uptitrated to maximally tolerated dose, 48 incident PD patients will be randomized to empagliflozin or control (no empagliflozin) for a total of 6 months. This study aims to explore the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, adequately powered randomized controlled trial that investigates the effect of empagliflozin on RKF in incident PD patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["End Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis","Peritoneal Dialysis Complication","Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor","Residual Kidney Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients randomized to intervention group will receive oral empagliflozin 10mg daily on top of optimized dose of RAAS inhibitor for 6 months","interventionNames":["Drug: Empagliflozin 10 MG"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients randomized to control group will receive optimized dose of RAAS inhibitor for 6 months"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Empagliflozin 10 MG","description":"empagliflozin oral 10mg daily for 6 months","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"],"otherNames":["Jardiance 10mg daily"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recruitment rate","description":"Number of patients who are randomized each month following the run-in period","timeFrame":"During randomization"},{"measure":"Medication adherence","description":"Proportion of prescribed empagliflozin that are taken by the patients (pill counting will be done by investigators at each follow up)","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Retention rate","description":"Proportion of patients who have completed the whole study among patients that are randomized","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Slope of residual GFR","description":"Residual GFR is calculated as the arithmetic mean of 24-hour urinary urea and creatinine clearances","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Time to anuria","description":"Anuria is defined as urine volume \\<100ml per day","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Difference in residual urine volume","description":"Residual urine volume is measured by 24-hour urine collection","timeFrame":"Month 0, 2, 4, 6"},{"measure":"Difference in volume of overhydration","description":"Volume of overhydration is measured by a validated multi-frequency bioimpedance spectroscopy","timeFrame":"Month 0, 2, 4, 6"},{"measure":"Difference in plasma N-terminal pro-brain type natriuretic peptide","description":"Indicator for left ventricular dysfunction","timeFrame":"Month 0, 2, 4, 6"},{"measure":"Difference in systolic blood pressure","description":"Office blood pressure will be measured according to standardized protocol.
