The stromal type, also known as HSV-1 stromal keratitis (HSK), is characterized by recurrent or chronic inflammation attributed to residual virus-triggered antigen-antibody-complement cascade reactions. BD111 is a lentivirus-like particle that is an active drug substance delivering gRNA-expressing cassettes and SpCas9 mRNA.The mechanism of action (MOA) is based on CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology.\n\nThis is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase I trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD profiles and preliminary efficacy of BD111 in patients with herpes simplex virus-1 stromal keratitis (HSK) in China. About 16 patients will be enrolled, dividing into open-label, four dose groups and one positive control (triple-drugs therapy) group. A rapid titration dose group combined with \"3+3\" dose escalation is designed for dose exploration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Herpes Simplex Virus Type I Stromal Keratitis"],"keywords":["Herpes simplex keratitis","Herpes Simplex Virus Type I","Stromal Keratitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BD111 dose 1 group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.25E+06 TU/eye","interventionNames":["Genetic: BD111 Injection (Investigative New Drug)"]},{"label":"BD111 dose 2 group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2.5E+06 TU/eye","interventionNames":["Genetic: BD111 Injection (Investigative New Drug)"]},{"label":"BD111 dose 3 group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"5.0E+06TU/eye","interventionNames":["Genetic: BD111 Injection (Investigative New Drug)"]},{"label":"BD111 dose 4 group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"10E+06 TU/eye","interventionNames":["Genetic: BD111 Injection (Investigative New Drug)"]},{"label":"Positive control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Triple-drugs therapy group: \"Ganciclovir Eye gel+Valacilovir Tablets+Prednisolone Acetate Eye Drops\" for 3 weeks.","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Triple-drugs therapy of HSV-1 stromal keratitis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"BD111 Injection (Investigative New Drug)","description":"BD111 Injection (Investigative New Drug) is a type of lentiviral-like particle, which can simultaneously deliver SpCas9 and gRNA targeting the HSV-1 virus gene, also known as HSV-1-erasing lentiviral particles (HELP).","armGroupLabels":["BD111 dose 1 group","BD111 dose 2 group","BD111 dose 3 group","BD111 dose 4 group"],"otherNames":["BD111 Lentivirus-like particles","HSV-1-erasing lentiviral particles","HELP"]},{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Triple-drugs therapy of HSV-1 stromal keratitis","description":"Triple-drugs therapy: \"Ganciclovir Eye gel+Valacilovir Tablets+Prednisolone Acetate Eye Drops\" for 3 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Positive control group"],"otherNames":["Ganciclovir Ophthalmic Gel","Valacyclovir Hydrochloride Tablets","Prednisolone Acetate Ophthalmic Suspension"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)","description":"DLT is defined as toxicity related to BD111 observed by the investigator and sponsor during the treatment period, specifically: a) Endophthalmitis; b) Corneal perforation; c) Hypopyon; d) Other toxicities that are significantly worse than baseline or defined as ≥ Grade 4 ocular toxicity and persist for 14 days or longer, which require trial termination after discussion with the investigator and sponsor; e) Any non-ocular Grade ≥ 3 abnormality that persists for more than 1 week or requires hospitalization for medical intervention; f) death.","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)","description":"The highest dose at which ≤1/3 of the subjects experience DLT during the DLT observation period.
