It affects about 14% of pregnancies worldwide. Women with gestational diabetes often feel more anxious and stressed and have a higher risk of depression during and after pregnancy. This study will explore how telerehabilitation can reduce anxiety and depression and show how exercise can improve the health of pregnant women with gestational diabetes.","detailedDescription":"The diagnosis of GDM can be unexpected and distressing, leading to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.Women with GDM are at a higher risk of experiencing prenatal and postnatal depression, which can affect their overall well-being and ability to care for their newborn. Regularly checking blood sugar levels, changing diet, and possibly using medication or insulin can be overwhelming. This constant effort and worry about complications can cause a lot of anxiety and stress. Many pregnant women with GDM might not fully understand how exercise can help control their blood sugar levels and improve their overall well-being. Developing a positive attitude towards exercise is important for helping people with gestational diabetes manage their condition effectively through physical activity. The use of telerehabilitation may improve psychological symptoms in participants with GDM.\n\nThe control group will receive routine medical care and the experimental group will receive structured telerehabilitation exercise protocol. The results of both groups will be recorded and compared to assess the effectiveness of using telerehabilitation in the treatment of women with GDM in improving psychological health."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy","Gestational Diabetes","Maternal Psychological Distress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"There will be two groups, experimental and control","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":62,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Telerehabilitation exercise group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive a structured tele rehabilitation exercise protocol (of low to moderate intensity warm up ,aerobic ,resistance and cool down exercises for 3 times a week progressively increased for 8 weeks) in addition to routine medical care for GDM.","interventionNames":["Other: Telerehabilitation exercise program"]},{"label":"Routine medical care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The control group will receive routine medical care including oral medication, diet and regular walk.","interventionNames":["Other: Routine medical care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Telerehabilitation exercise program","description":"5 min warmup will include ankle plantar and dorsiflexion ,trunk side flexion ,shoulder circles ,shoulder ROMS.it will be followed by 5 min aerobics that includes spot marching and side stepping. it will be followed by resistance exercise which will be divided into 3 groups. each group of exercise will be performed one day each. chair squats, arm pulls, seated triceps, biceps curls etc. are included in these resistance exercises. intensity of each exercise will be progressively increased","armGroupLabels":["Telerehabilitation exercise group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Routine medical care","description":"The control group will be given routine medical care (including dietary modification, oral anti diabetics (metformin) and advised to do regular walk (20-30min/day).","armGroupLabels":["Routine medical care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Center of Epidemiologic studies depression scale (CES-D)","description":"The CES-DC is an inventory of 20 self-report items regarding depressive symptoms, taking about 5 minutes to completeIn scoring the CES-D, a value of 0, 1, 2 or 3 is assigned to a response depending upon whether the item is worded positively or negatively.Possible range of scores is 0 to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.","timeFrame":"changes from baseline to 8th week"},{"measure":"Strait trait anxiety inventory (STAI)","description":"It is a psychological inventory consisting of 40 self-report items on a 4-point Likert scale.The total score ranges from 0-63.The following guidelines are recommended for the interpretation of scores: 0-9, normal or no anxiety;
