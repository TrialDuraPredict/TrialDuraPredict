The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDoes visual feedback balance training system combined with RFE reduce the fall risk of participants? Can the combination of intelligent rehabilitation robot training system and RFE achieve better effects?\n\nResearchers will compare 3 groups (RFE, visual feedback balance training system under RFE, and conventional therapy) to see if visual feedback balance training system and RFE works to treat stroke.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nReceive treatment for 4 weeks Receive scale and instrument testing before and after treatment"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"time up and go test (TUG)","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"},{"measure":"10-meter walk test (10-MWT)","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Center of gravity loss index","description":"Use the Libra parameters evaluation system included with visual feedback balance training system","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Deviation of bilateral center of gravity movement area","description":"Use the Libra parameters evaluation system included with visual feedback balance training system","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"functional ambulation category scale (FAC)","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"},{"measure":"Berg balance scale (BBS)","timeFrame":"From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients (18 to 74 years old) who suffered a first or second unilateral stroke\n* chronic stroke (over 6 months from the onset)\n* moderate or higher risk of falls (TUG \\> 15s, or 10-MWT â‰¤ 0.8m/s)\n* ability to understand and follow simple directions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnant or lactating\n* lower extremity contracture, pain, or trauma\n* perceptual, apraxic, or cognitive deficits that lead to inability to follow verbal instructions\n* unable to maintain standing posture\n* cerebellar lesion\n* clinically unstable medical disorders\n* inability to provide informed consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"74 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jingzhi Zhang","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86-16677137704","email":"170787717@qq.com"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M22306","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5810","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5204","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5742","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17400","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
