A total of 20 patients diagnosed with ASD will be recruited to evaluate the feasibility of home healthcare application of afVNS and for assessment of short-term treatment effects on symptoms and comorbidities. ASD patients will receive 1 x hour per day afVNS treatment over 14 days with a fixed neuromodulation protocol. The primary outcome measure is feasibility assessed from completion success and neurostimulation tolerance. Secondary outcome measures include changes in scores pre- and post- afVNS treatment for Clinician Global Clinical Impression (CGI-I), Clinician Global Impression Severity (CGI-S), Children's Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI-R), Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale for ASD (PRAS-ASD), Autistic Behavior Checklist (ABC), Cleveland Adolescent Sleep Questionnaire (CASQ), verbal fluency and biomarker measures in autonomic physiology."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Autism Spectrum Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DEVICE_FEASIBILITY","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Receiving intervention of the non-invasive neurostimulation device.","interventionNames":["Device: vagus nerve stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"vagus nerve stimulation","description":"Non-invasive Auricular Fiber Vagus Nerve Stimulation (afVNS)","armGroupLabels":["Treatment Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility for completed treatments and stimulation intensity tolerance","description":"Completion success and neurostimulation tolerance","timeFrame":"1 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinician Global Clinical Impression (CGI-I)","description":"For core social impairment and overall level of cognitive, adaptive and social functioning","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Clinician Global Impression Severity (CGI-S)","description":"For assessment of anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms and social interactions and overall ASD","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale for ASD (PRAS-ASD)","description":"For anxiety assessment consisting of 25 questions related to anxiety ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Autistic Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores","description":"For measurements of 5 behavioral domains including irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypy, hyperactivity and inappropriate speech","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Written informed consent\n* Age: between 7 and 26 years\n* Participants and parent/ guardian must read and write English\n* Diagnosis of ASD as defined by ADOS-2 and DSM-5 criteria\n* Full scale IQ of \\>80 from WASI\n* Suffering from anxiety (total score of \\>49) on CASI-R at baseline\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. bipolar, major depressive disorder)\n* Severe neurological disorders (e.g. stroke, epilepsy)\n* Bradyarrhythmia\n* History of head trauma (surgery or tumor)\n* Active medical implants (cochlear, VNS or pacemakers)\n* Cerebral shunts\n* Auricular skin disease that compromises placement of electrodes\n* Pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"7 Years","maximumAge":"26 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Daniel Ko, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+85255308212","email":"danielko@neuro-pix.com"},{"name":"Angela Peng, Bsc","role":"CONTACT","email":"angelapeng@neuropix.co"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Daniel Ko, PhD","affiliation":"Neuropix","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"35053839","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Molero-Chamizo A, Nitsche MA, Bolz A, Andujar Barroso RT, Alameda Bailen JR, Garcia Palomeque JC, Rivera-Urbina GN.
