For these three parameters, points were assigned based on offset with age-adjusted targets 0 points if the parameter was within 10 years of the patient's age (Match). For each 20 years above the age-adjusted target, 1 point was added (e.g., + 1 point between + 10 and + 30, + 2 points between +30 and +50). Conversely, 1 point was subtracted for each 20 years below the age-adjusted target (e.g., -1 point between -10 and -30, -2 points between -30 and -50). SAAS was calculated by adding all 3 components, creating a discreet score that could have a negative value (under corrected) or positive value (over corrected). SAAS was sub-categorized into \"SAAS-Under\" if it was less than -1, \"SAAS-Match\" if it was between -1 and + 1 or \"SAAS-Over\" if it was greater than + 1.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with ASD undergoing correction surgery in reference to SAAS score."]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proximal Junctional Kyphosis","description":"Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) was defined by a proximal junctional angle (PJA) (Cobb angle between the superior endplate of UIV+2 and inferior endplate of UIV) of \\> 10° and a PJA angle difference of \\> 10° from baseline at any time point up to latest follow-up.","timeFrame":"Two years after surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Scoliosis Research Society-22","description":"The 22-item SRS-22r questionnaire is specific to scoliosis-related patient-reported outcomes, and consists of 6 domains: function, pain, self-image, mental health, satisfaction, and subtotal, with each domain being scored from 1 to 5 where higher scores correspond to better patient outcomes.","timeFrame":"One month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery"},{"measure":"Oswestry disability index","description":"The validated ODI is a self-administered questionnaire for evaluating back-specific functional disability, consisting of 10 items with scores from 0 to 5, and higher ODI indicates more severe disability.","timeFrame":"One month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery"},{"measure":"Achievement of minimal clinically important difference","description":"A prespecified MCID of 10 points was used for the ODI.
