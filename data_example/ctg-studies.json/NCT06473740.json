The researchers hypothesized that the combination treatment would significantly reduce the number of re-interventions on the operated segment and high amputations, and also significantly increase the time interval between re-interventions.","detailedDescription":"Objective - To prove the effectiveness and safety of combined endovascular treatment and gene therapy for Fontaine grades III and IV CI (Rutherford grades 4 and 5) in comparison with isolated endovascular treatment by comparing the immediate and long-term results of the two techniques, assessed using clinical and instrumental methods.\n\nNull hypothesis (Н0) - After endovascular treatment in combination with gene therapy with supercoiled plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid pCMV-VEGF165 in patients with critical ischemia of the lower limb III and IV degrees according to Fontaine (categories 4 and 5 according to Rutherford), the number of re-interventions on the operated segment and the number high amputations will be the same as after isolated endovascular treatment.\n\nThe frequency of re-interventions on the operated segment during endovascular interventions in the long-term period according to the main randomized clinical trials (BASIL 1, BASIL 2, BEST-CLI) is 25.9%, 19.0%, 23.5%, and the number of high amputations (BASIL 1, BASIL 2) - 19.1% and 18.0% respectively. High amputations lead to disability and loss of performance, incl. and working population. Within 5 years after major amputation, more than half of patients die from concomitant diseases. Each repeat revascularization is significantly more difficult and longer than the previous intervention, reducing the potential for future interventions.\n\nIn this regard, the search for new modern minimally invasive methods for the treatment of critical ischemia of the lower extremities, which will help to significantly reduce the number of high amputations and repeated interventions, as well as increase the intervals between repeated interventions, is an extremely important medical and economic problem."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Lower Limb Ischemia"],"keywords":["gene therapy","amputation","severe lower limb ischemia","endovascular treatment","stenting","balloon angioplasty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":386,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Best endovascular treatment + Introduction Neovasculgen (International nonproprietary or group name: deoxyribonucleic acid plasmid supercoiled pCMV-VEGF165).

Recombinant plasmid DNA consists of the following components: a fragment of the regulatory region (22 nucleotide pairs), which determines the transcription of the gene, the VEGF minigene, upon expression of which the VEGF isoform is synthesized, consisting of 165 amino acids, a splicing signal, a polyadenylation signal and the SV40 transcription terminator, ensuring the synthesis of the mature RNA gene and auxiliary regions required for efficient biosynthesis of plasmid DNA in the cells of the producer strain of Escherichia coli. When molecules of this plasmid penetrate into mammalian cells, VEGF is produced, which stimulates endothelial cells, which leads to the growth of blood vessels (vascularization) in the area of injection.","armGroupLabels":["Observation group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numper of participants with freedom from repeated interventions on the operated segment","description":"the need for re-intervention on the operated segment will be determined based on the clinical data (return of severe ischemia of the operated limb) together with ultrasound and/or computed tomography data; counting the number of re-interventions in the study group","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"Numper of participants with freedom from high amputations","description":"amputations will be performed in patients with the development of gangrene of the lower limb; counting the number of high amputations in each study group","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"amputation-free survival","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"overall survival","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"time to major amputation","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"time to MALE (Major adverse limb event )","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"time to MACE (Major adverse cardiovascular event )","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"change time in pain-free walking distance","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"safety assessment - monitoring for serious adverse events throughout the study after the first drug administration","description":"according to the researchers and the monitor","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"Number of participants with mortality","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 30 days after the first revascularization"},{"measure":"VAS(Visual Pain System) pain reduction from 0 to 10, where 0 - no pain and 10 - very strong pain","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"Dynamics of ulcerchealing in diabetic foot syndrome according to the PEDIS classification (Perfusion, Extent, Depth, Infection, Sensation)","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"},{"measure":"Hemodynamic measurements (ankle brachial index changes)","description":"database data","timeFrame":"within 2 years after the intervention"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
