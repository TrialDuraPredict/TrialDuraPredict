Integration of MRI into early treatment response assessment will add further prognostic value and permits response-adapted therapy which can improve quality of survivorship children through toxicity reduction. It also allows identification of patients who either have had or are likely to have a suboptimal response to treatment, facilitating the potential consideration of treatment escalation.\n\nThe sample size of this study is not intended to change clinical practice, but rather provide a basis for international collaboration to achieve larger patient numbers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma","Head and Neck Cancer","Nasopharyngeal Cancer","Epstein-Barr Virus"],"keywords":["Nasopharyngeal, cancer, proton beam, epstein-barr virus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Epstein-barr virus DNA, within blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Plasma EBV during proton beam RT","description":"Taken weekly, prior to each session of chemotherapy.
