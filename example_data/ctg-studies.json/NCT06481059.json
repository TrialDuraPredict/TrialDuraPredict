The study enrolled 150 participants, 50 chronic periodontitis with head and neck cancer post radiotherapy (CP+HNC post-RT) patients, 50 chronic periodontitis (CP) without HNC patients, and 50 healthy controls. Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL), Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Plaque Index (PI), and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) were recorded. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was constructed to quantify serum (suPAR) levels. Stage and grade of periodontitis were stage III-IV, grade C in patients (CP+HNC post-RT), stage I-III, grade A/B in patients (CP without HNC), and absent in (healthy). Chronic periodontitis with HNC post-RT patients presented a significantly higher proportion of suPAR levels (506.7 pg/ml) compared to chronic periodontitis without HNC and healthy controls (423.08 pg/ml and 255.9 pg/ml), respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between serum suPAR levels and CAL, PPD, PI, and GBI in the periodontal disease groups. ROC results of suPAR (AUC=0.976 for CP+HNC post-RT, AUC=0.872 for CP without HNC). Hyposalivation appeared in patients (CP+HNC post-RT; 0.15 \\[0.11-0.23\\] ml/min, P=0.001) and (CP without HNC; 0.30 \\[0.25-0.41\\] ml/min, P=0.001), compared to healthy controls; 0.35 \\[0.28- 0.54\\] ml/min, P=0.001). The study showed a significant elevation in serum suPAR levels in CP+HNC post-RT patients compared to the CP without HNC and control groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Head and Neck Cancer","Chronic Periodontitis","Radiotherapy; Complications"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Head and neck cancer post-radiotherapy","description":"Head and neck cancer patients who received radiotherapy after six months. fractions no. \\[(32-35 fractions) 5700-7000 Gy\\] addition chemotherapy \\[(cisplatin or cetuximab) (2-3 doses)\\].","interventionNames":["Radiation: Head and Neck cancer post-radiotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Head and Neck cancer post-radiotherapy","description":"Head and Neck Cancer patients who received radiotherapy after 6 months","armGroupLabels":["Head and neck cancer post-radiotherapy"],"otherNames":["Head and neck cancer patients after 6 irradiation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measure of serum suPAR level","description":"Measure of serum suPAR level in patients head and neck cancer who received radiotherapy","timeFrame":"at 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Periodontal parameters measured","description":"All periodontal parameters (Clinical attachment level, Gingival bleeding Index, Plaque index, and Periodontal pocket depth measures were performed manually using a millimeter periodontal probe in patients who received radiotherapy.","timeFrame":"at 6 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* A pathologically confirmed malignant neoplasm of HNC (derived from epithelial cells).\n* Not having received radiation therapy previously.\n* No distant metastasis.\n* No history of salivary gland surgery (parotid, submandibular, or sublingual).\n* A generally satisfactory physical condition with a performance score of 0 to 1 point and a planned survival period of more than a year and scores of 2 higher indicating increasing disability.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous oral disease or salivary gland disease history.\n* Definitive diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, xerostomia, or systemic disease.\n* Refusal to participate in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"28 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The study was n=26 nasopharyngeal tumors (n=20 nonkeratinizing and n=6 keratinizing carcinomas), (n=6 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, SCC), (n=8 Laryngeal cancer), (n=6 tongue cancer), and (n=4 primary malignancies of unclear origin).
