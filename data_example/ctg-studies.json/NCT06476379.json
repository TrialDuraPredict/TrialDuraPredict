In our study, we aim to compare the outcomes of preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) and the subsequent clinical outcomes following transfers of euploid embryos. This comparison will be conducted between cases where ejaculated sperm and cases where testicular sperm were used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), specifically focusing on severe male factor infertility patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Male
