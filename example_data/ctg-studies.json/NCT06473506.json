The saliva sample testing will be compared to the throat swab testing to see if saliva testing works as well. The lab will also try different testing methods to see if a faster type of testing (e.g. molecular testing) works as well as the regular method, which takes 48 hours to get results.\n\nThis is important because throat swabs can be challenging to collect in some children, and saliva is often much easier and more acceptable by children to collect. This could improve our ability to accurately diagnose and treat GAS infections."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Group A Streptococcal Infections"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Saliva collection","type":"OTHER","description":"Self-collected saliva sample","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Saliva collection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Saliva collection","description":"Self-collected saliva sample with molecular testing performed.
