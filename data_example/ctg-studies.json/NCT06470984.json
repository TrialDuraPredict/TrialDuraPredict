The intervention is an ethics education pathway, which will be used for approximately 60-80 patient-facing nurse leaders who practice in either acute care or post-acute care over a 6-week period. One Pre and two post-assessment questionnaires will be distributed, which include the \"Ethical Competence Support Questionnaire\" © and the \"Ethical Safety Questionnaire\" ©.
