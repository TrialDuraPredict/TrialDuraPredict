The deposition and oxidation of LDL-cholesterol particles triggers a series of molecular events favoring chronic low-grade inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress. This situation promotes atherogenesis thus increasing cardiovascular risk. Obesity favors the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and promotes the recruitment of macrophages to adipose tissue, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, thus increasing the risk of CVD. In addition, obesity has been associated with gut dysbiosis, which in turn is associated with atherosclerosis in some studies. Beneficial effects of PS on LDL-cholesterol and inflammatory, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress markers have been reported by several clinical trials. A meta-analysis suggests a lowering effect of PS on body mass index (BMI) in participants with BMI\\>25. Furthermore, the consumption of PS has been beneficially associated in in vitro studies with changes in intestinal microbial profile, sterol metabolism and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) production. Therefore, the hypothesis is if the consumption of PS as a food supplementation could reduce cardiovascular risk. The present study aims to evaluate the LDL-cholesterol serum levels after regular intake of a food supplement containing PS (2 g/day) in overweight/obese type 1 or 2 patients, normoglycemic /pre-diabetic and with LDL-cholesterol values \\> 115 mg/dl not pharmacologically treated. This is a crossover study with 21 participants (intake of a food supplement containing PS) and 21 participants (intake of excipient-based placebo), with a first intervention period of 8 weeks. After a 6-week washout period, the treatments are switched, with a second intervention period of 8 weeks. In addition, to the LDL-cholesterol lowering assessment, other biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress parameters are assessed in serum samples. Moreover, sterol and metabolite profiling in serum and feces, microbiota modulation, anthropometric measurements and body composition, bioimpedance, dietary intake and physical activity questionnaire are evaluated. All parameters are evaluated at the beginning (weeks 0 and 14) and at the end of each intervention period (weeks 8 and 22)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiovascular
