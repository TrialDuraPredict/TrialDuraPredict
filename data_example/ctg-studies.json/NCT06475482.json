The inclusion criteria will include subjects with subjective complaint of dry lips.The main question it aims to answer is Does the novel polyherbal lip hydrant improve biophysical barrier of the lips?\n* Participant will be asked to apply the lip hydrant or the petroleum gel once a day before bedtime, and refrain from using other lip products throughout the clinical trial period (28 days).\n* Researchers will compare control group (Petroleum gel) with lip hydrant group to see whether biophysical barrier (wrinkles, colors, fine lines, roughness) improve or not."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cheilitis"],"keywords":["Cheilitis","Aging","Lip roughness","Prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial will be conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University.
