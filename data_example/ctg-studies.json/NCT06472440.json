There is an urgent need for non-invasive imaging tools to evaluate a glioma throughout its management. At present, the diagnosis of certainty is only obtained through an anatomo-pathological analysis with sampling during an invasive procedure (surgery or biopsy). Magnetic resonance imaging, through perfusion, diffusion imaging or spectroscopy is developing in gliomas. However, it remains time-consuming and is not always available. At the same time, positron emission tomography (PET) with amino acids is an interesting alternative for these brain tumours. Amino acid PET has the advantage of being more specific than the abnormalities detected in MRI and the amino acid radiotracers cross the blood-brain barrier, even if not broken, unlike Gadolinium in MRI. Among these radiotracers, 18F-FDOPA can, among other things, assist in the non-invasive staging of gliomas at initial diagnosis"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Glioma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of parameters extracted from radiomic analysis to predict the molecular characteristics of gliomas at initial diagnosis.","description":"Accuracy of the method","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of parameters extracted from radiomic analysis to predict glioma recurrence","description":"Sensibility of the method","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of parameters extracted from radiomic analysis to predict the response to glioma treatments.","description":"specificity of the method","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient having performed a PET/CT examination at 18F-FDOPA for his glioma in the nuclear medicine department of the CHRU de Brabois for which the raw data are available;\n* Person who received full information on the organization of the research and did not object to the use of these data;\n* Patients affiliated to a social security scheme\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPerson who received full information on the organization of the research and who objected to the use of the data\n\n* Adult person subject to a legal protection measure (guardianship, curatorship, safeguard of justice).\n* A person of full age who is unable to give consent and who is not subject to a legal protection measure.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"95 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients referred for a brain PET/CT examination using 18F-FDOPA (between 01/JAN/2020 and 01/JUN/2024) and presenting a histologically confirmed glioma","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Antoine VERGER, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0383155567","phoneExt":"+33","email":"a.verger@chru-nancy.fr"},{"name":"VERONIQUE ROCH, MSc","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0383154276","phoneExt":"+33","email":"v.roch@chru-nancy.fr"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000005910","term":"Glioma"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000018302","term":"Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial"},{"id":"D000017599","term":"Neuroectodermal Tumors"},{"id":"D000009373","term":"Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal"},{"id":"D000009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009375","term":"Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial"},{"id":"D000009380","term":"Neoplasms, Nerve Tissue"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9020","name":"Glioma","asFound":"Glioma","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M20446","name":"Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19845","name":"Neuroectodermal Tumors","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M20388","name":"Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12318","name":"Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12315","name":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12320","name":"Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12325","name":"Neoplasms, Nerve Tissue","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T2519","name":"Glioma","asFound":"Glioma","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"T4092","name":"Neuroepithelioma","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7471","name":"Dihydroxyphenylalanine","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
