However, it is not clear whether the simulation attenuates or accentuates the levels of stress and anxiety. The standard learning model, as it does not contemplate different learning styles, may present deficiencies in the student's preparation for the simulated strategy, allowing negative effects, such as stress and anxiety, to easily appear. On the other hand, the adoption of an Integrated Learning Support System (ILSS), covering different learning styles, would be more effective, above all, to prevent or mitigate the possible negative effects of the simulated strategy, the theme defended in this proposal. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an ILSS applied during the preparation of undergraduate nursing students for immersive simulated training in the management of drug-induced nephrotoxicity. A parallel randomized controlled trial guided by the CONSORT recommendations extended to health simulation research will be conducted. Data collection will take place in two higher education institutions in the Federal District, Brazil, one public and one private, chosen for being a reference in teaching mediated by the simulation strategy. Study participants will be undergraduate nursing students. A sample size calculation resulted in the need for 96 students. The following instruments will be adopted: 1) Questionnaire to characterize the participants; 2) Questionnaire to assess theoretical knowledge; 3) Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric, Brazilian version; 4) Checklist for evaluating practical performance; 5) Reduced version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). In this study, a theoretical-practical course will be created and offered on the systematization of nursing care for patients with drug-induced nephrotoxicity. The syllabus of the course is divided into online and face-to-face modes. Students will be submitted in pairs to previously created and validated simulation scenarios. In the Control Group, students will be submitted to the Standard Learning Model (SLM) during the preparation stage for the immersive simulated training, consisting of: use of expository video lessons, participation in doubt forums, reading, and critical analysis of scientific articles. For the Experimental Group, in addition to the SLM, an ILSS composed of strategies to achieve different learning styles will be added. The study outcomes will be: acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes towards the management of drug-induced nephrotoxicity; reduction of self-reported levels of stress. Categorical variables will be expressed in absolute and relative frequencies, and scalar and continuous numerical variables will be expressed in summary measures (mean and median) and dispersion (standard deviation and 25th and 75th percentiles). The normality of the variables will be verified by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. The Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Fisher's exact tests will be adopted for correlations between groups and the Wilcoxon test for intragroup correlations, considering results with p values â‰¤ 0.05 as significant. The Integrated Learning Support System (ILSS) will be another tool available to nursing educators to promote environments conducive to professional development with a reduction of factors that negatively interfere with the learning process, such as anxiety and stress. In the long term, it is expected to stimulate the implementation of simulation as an active, educational, and permanent methodology for undergraduate nursing students, aiming at training professionals capable of promoting improvements in the quality of care practice and, consequently, patient safety."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Simulation Training","Learning","Educational Technology","Nephrotoxicity","Physiological Stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"This study will adopt a double-blind approach. The exchange of information between the students who will compose the Experimental and Control groups is already expected, that is, the contamination effect, which causes a tendency to underestimate the true effect of the intervention. In this sense, throughout the duration of the simulated scenarios, a flow will be established in which each group (intervention and control) of students will be kept in different environments, to guarantee confinement, a condition that will prevent contact between the different groups. The main researcher will be blinded, that is, he will not have knowledge about the distribution of groups (randomization) and who will receive the Integrated Learning Support System (ILSS). The statistician responsible for data analysis will also be blinded, as he will receive and analyze coded data, without knowing the identity of the participants and the intervention allocated to each one.","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":95,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Integrated Learning Support System (ILSS)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For the Experimental Group, in addition to the Standard Learning Model (MPA), an Integrated Learning Support System (ILSS) will be added, consisting of strategies to achieve different learning styles","interventionNames":["Other: Integrated Learning Support System"]},{"label":"Standard Learning Model (SLM)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In the Control Group, students will be submitted to the Standard Learning Model (SLM) during the preparation stage for the immersive simulated training, consisting of: use of expository video lessons, participation in doubt forums, reading and critical analysis of scientific articles.","interventionNames":["Other: Standard Learning Model"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Integrated Learning Support System","description":"Students will receive simulation preparation with an Integrated Learning Support System consisting of:\n\n* Educational technology in comic book format\n* Virtual monitoring system with tutors\n* Psychological follow-up\n* Music listening and relaxation session","armGroupLabels":["Integrated Learning Support System (ILSS)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Standard Learning Model","description":"Students will receive standard simulation preparation consisting of:\n\n- Expository and dialogued theoretical class.","armGroupLabels":["Standard Learning Model (SLM)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Knowledge about Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephrotoxicity (baseline)","description":"Assessment of knowledge about prevention of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity using a standardized questionnaire.
