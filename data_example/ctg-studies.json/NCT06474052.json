Adult patients undergoing open vascular surgery, including femoral and carotid endarterectomy as well as bypass surgery, received general anesthesia. Following the induction of anesthesia, Gelofusine 4% was administered at a dosage of 10 ml/kg over a 30-minute period. Hemoglobin concentration was monitored for up to 180 minutes post-administration to construct a plasma hemodilution profile.","detailedDescription":"Gelofusine 4% was administered at a dosage of 10 ml/kg over a 30-minute period to adult patients undergoing uncomplicated vascular surgery. Arterial blood samples were taken to measure blood hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit at baseline and at 5-minute intervals up to 60 minutes after the infusion began, followed by 10-minute intervals up to 90 minutes, and then at 30-minute intervals up to 180 minutes. Urine output and total intraoperative blood loss were continuously monitored. The plasma hemodilution data were fitted to a bicompartmental model to derive the intercompartmental kinetics of Gelofusine 4%."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fluid Electrolyte Disorders"],"keywords":["colloid","volume kinetics","Gelofusine 4%"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gelofusine 4%","description":"Adult patients undergoing uncomplicated vascular surgery.","interventionNames":["Drug: Gelofusine 4%"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Gelofusine 4%","description":"Gelofusine 4% 10 ml/kg is administered following anaesthesia induction in 30 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["Gelofusine 4%"],"otherNames":["Colloid"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Plasma Volume","description":"Plasma volume was determined using a two-compartment kinetic model with three rate constants (k12, k21, and k10) and a scaling factor (Vc, central volume) that relates dilution to volume.
