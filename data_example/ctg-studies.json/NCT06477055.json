Approximately 60 NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations (19del, L858R) who received adjuvant osimertinib after complete resection were enrolled. The primary endpoint was to assess the recurrence gene profiles of adjuvant Osimertinib therapy. The secondary endpoint was to explore of subgroups recurrence gene profiles of different recurrence types (local /distant) after adjuvant Osimertinib therapy and to describe the diverse treatment patterns in real clinical practice after the disease progressed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["EGFR","Osimertinib"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All the patients were treated with osimertinib.","interventionNames":["Drug: Osimertinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Osimertinib","description":"Osimertinib, 80mg, po, qd.","armGroupLabels":["Experimental group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence gene profiles","description":"To assess the recurrence gene profiles of adjuvant Osimertinib therapy","timeFrame":"Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence gene profiles in patients with different recurrence types (local /distant)","description":"To explore of subgroups recurrence gene profiles of different recurrence types (local /distant) after adjuvant Osimertinib therapy","timeFrame":"Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month"},{"measure":"Subsequent treatment patterns","description":"To describe the diverse treatment patterns (Osi or other EGFR TKIs，± chemo) in real clinical practice after the disease progressed","timeFrame":"Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence gene profiles per DFS difference","description":"To explore the different recurrence gene profiles associated with clinical efficacy (DFS) in tumour or blood samples","timeFrame":"Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
