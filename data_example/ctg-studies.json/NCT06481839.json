To date, there are no clinical guidelines or recommendations regarding the dose of vasopressor medication that should be initiated before titrating to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients with circulatory shock. High heterogeneity and clinical equipoise regarding this variable exist in routine clinical practice. However, there is strong evidence that delays in achieving MAP goals lead to worse clinical outcomes. The study will randomize patients with circulatory shock to a low (5mcg/min of norepinephrine) or high (15mcg/min of norepinephrine) initial starting dose followed by the usual protocolized titration to MAP goal. The time to reach the goal MAP, organ dysfunction, hospital length of stay, and mortality will be measured for each group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Shock"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low-dose NE","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Starting dose of NE"]},{"label":"High-dose NE","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Starting dose of NE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Starting dose of NE","description":"Patients will be randomized to either low-dose (5mcg/min) or high-dose (15mcg/min) norepinephrine (NE) for their first vasopressor in shock.","armGroupLabels":["High-dose NE","Low-dose NE"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Mean arterial blood pressure","description":"Time to achieve and sustain a mean arterial pressor greater than or equal to 65 mmHg","timeFrame":"During first shock episode, up to 28 days of shock episode."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients at least 18 years old\n* Patients who are diagnosed with shock (MAP \\< 65 mmHg) require the initiation of vasopressors\n* Care provided in the ED or admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU)\n* Norepinephrine chosen as first-line vasopressor by the treating clinician\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving vasopressors or inotropes prior to UI Health hospital presentation/admission\n* Baseline MAP \\>/= 65 mmHg\n* Pregnant patients (checked as standard of care on admission)\n* Prisoners.\n* Immediate post-cardiac arrest patients","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Scott Benken","role":"CONTACT","phone":"312-355-4107","email":"benken@uic.edu"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000012769","term":"Shock"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010335","term":"Pathologic Processes"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M15577","name":"Shock","asFound":"Shock","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M12575","name":"Norepinephrine","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17409","name":"Vasoconstrictor Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"VaCoAg","name":"Vasoconstrictor Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
