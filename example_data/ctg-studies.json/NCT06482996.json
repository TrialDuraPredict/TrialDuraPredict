The secondary objective is to explore the relationship between preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure changes and frailty scores.","detailedDescription":"Cataract stands as a significant cause of vision impairment worldwide, notably prevalent among the elderly. This study aims to explore the changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and blood pressure under general anesthesia during cataract surgery in frail geriatric patients. The research emphasizes the critical role of frailty assessment in determining surgical risks among elderly surgical patients. It focuses on the hypothesis that frail individuals undergoing cataract surgery under general anesthesia might experience more pronounced effects on IOP and blood pressure during the surgical procedure compared to prefrail counterparts. This study emerges as a crucial step in understanding the impact of preoperative frailty assessment on surgical planning and outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cataract"],"keywords":["Cataract surgery","Frailty"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Day","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group A","description":"Frail scale:Non frail","interventionNames":["Other: Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured"]},{"label":"group B","description":"Frail scale: Pre frail/frail","interventionNames":["Other: Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured","description":"The Frail Scale was used to assess the frailty of the patients.Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before anesthesia, 5 minutes after induction of anesthesia and 1 hour postoperatively.
