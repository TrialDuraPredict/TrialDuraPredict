In the literature, the investigators did not observe any prospective study analysing the use of absorbable single clip and Hem-o-lok single clip. In this prospective study, the reliability of the two methods will be compared using a single clip.","detailedDescription":"In this prospective randomised controlled clinical study; closure of the cystic duct in laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be performed by two different methods.
