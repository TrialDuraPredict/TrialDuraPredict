They will be randomized to pharmaco-mechanical thrombolysis combined with anticoagulant therapy with direct oral anticoagulant versus direct anticoagulant therapy alone. They will be monitored, and patients in the anticoagulation-only group may undergo stenting angioplasty in the chronic phase if they present a moderate post-thrombotic syndrome or venous claudication. At the end of 30 months, a medico-economic analysis will be carried out."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Iliofemoral Venous
