In this study, the investigators compared the effects of IV forms of ibuprofen and acetaminophen on pain perception and opioid consumption following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.The participants in this study were randomized into two groups. Participants in Group I (group ibuprofen, n=35) were administered 800 mg of IV ibuprofen; participants in Group A (group acetaminophen, n=36) were administered 1000 mg of IV acetaminophen. The investigators recorded demographic data including gender, age, ASA, BMI, duration of anesthesia and surgery, poNV, LOS, VAS scores and opioid consumption postoperatively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Post-operative Pain"],"keywords":["intravenous ibuprofen","acetaminophen","laparoscopic cholecystectomy","postoperative pain control","analgesia","anti-inflammatory agents"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The present study included ASA grade I-II participants aged 18-65 years scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
