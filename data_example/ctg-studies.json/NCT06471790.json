While the clinical effects of ambulation during labor remain controversial, there is a consensus on its positive impact on the birthing experience and satisfaction.\n\nEpidural analgesia remains the gold standard for pain control during labor, with a utilization rate of 82% in France. Recent advancements in obstetric analgesia have allowed for lower doses of analgesics, often administered via patient-controlled analgesia, which maintains the potential for ambulation during labor. However, only a small number of maternity units in France offer this technique. The main barriers include organizational issues such as unsuitable facilities, lack of wireless telemetry, and potential risks such as falls and hypotension.\n\nSignificant changes in gait characteristics are observed throughout pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, and are studied in laboratory settings using video capture and analysis. Gait during labor is influenced by pain, fetal progression, and anatomical changes in the pelvis. The presence of epidural analgesia, where local anesthetics likely affect neural transmission, may impact motor commands and sensory feedback, further altering gait characteristics. These biomechanical aspects of labor remain understudied.\n\nWearable inertial sensors show promise in maternal health monitoring by providing real-time data for motion and gait studies. However, their application has not been described or validated during labor, particularly in walking conditions. Continuous dynamic study of gait in these conditions could enable non-invasive, non-intrusive monitoring of analgesia effectiveness, fall risk prediction, and labor progression analysis.\n\nThe aim of this feasibility study is to validate the use of wearable inertial sensors to quantify movements and characterize gait during the first stage of labor, both with and without low-dose epidural analgesia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pregnancy Related","Epidural; Anesthesia, Headache","Labor Complication"],"keywords":["PREGNANCY","LABOR","EPIDURAL ANALGESIA","WALKING EPIDURAL","MOVEMENTS","GAIT","INERTIAL SENSOR"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Walking Epidural Analgesia for Labor","description":"Pregnant women in labor who benefit from walking epidural analgesia technique will be monitored using inertial wearable sensors beginning from the first stage of labor and up to delivery."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"triaxial (x, y, z) velocity changes over time unit (dV/dt) = m/s2 (meter over square second)","description":"gait patterns derived from accelerometer data measuring acceleration in three axes (x, y, z)","timeFrame":"during walking starting from the demand of the parturient to have an epidural up to delivery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* pregnancy \\>= 38 gestation weeks\n* no significant medical history (American Society of Anesthesiologists class ASA 1)\n* receiving low-dose epidural analgesia with ambulation (in accordance with current service protocol)\n* not opposed to the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Refusal to participate in this study\n* Non-French-speaking patient\n* History of osteoarticular pathology likely to change gate (severe scoliosis, spinal surgery, congenital hip deformity, pelvic fracture, ligament or knee joint pathology)\n* adults under legal protection\n* multiple pregnancy\n* need for continuous intravenous infusion with infusion stand during ambulation","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"at-term (\\>= 38 gestation weeks) women admitted to the maternity facility for labor and delivery and willing low dose epidural analgesia with walking option","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Mikhail DZIADZKO, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"04.26.10.93.25","phoneExt":"+33","email":"mikhail.dziadzko@chu-lyon.fr"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Mikhail PH DZIADZKO, MD","affiliation":"Anesthésie Réanimation Douleur","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hôpital de la Croix Rousse","city":"Lyon","zip":"69004","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Mikhail DZIADZKO, MD","role":"CONTACT"},{"name":"Mikhail DZIADZKO, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.74848,"lon":4.84669}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000007744","term":"Obstetric Labor Complications"},{"id":"D000006261","term":"Headache"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000010146","term":"Pain"},{"id":"D000009461","term":"Neurologic Manifestations"},{"id":"D000011248","term":"Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M9351","name":"Headache","asFound":"Headache","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10764","name":"Obstetric Labor Complications","asFound":"Labor Complications","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M13066","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12404","name":"Neurologic Manifestations","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14127","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2875","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27093","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8399","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
