There is a two-week washout period between treatments. During these treatment phases, subjects will complete questionnaires about their daily experiences of breathlessness and wear a watch that records various health parameters.\n\nThe study includes eight visits: the initial enrollment and follow-up checks every two weeks. At these visits, subjects undergo tests for lung function and walking distance, and complete health status questionnaires. Additionally, blood samples for THC levels and hair samples for cortisol analysis are collected."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["COPD","Breathlessness","Cannabis"],"keywords":["Randomized, Controlled, Double-blind, Crossover trial","Cannabis-based medicine","Cannabis","COPD","Breathlessness"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"A randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover trial","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"An external party will manage the randomization process, assigning participants equally to either the active treatment or placebo groups in a 1:1 ratio.
