Forty eligible participants will be recruited in the trial. BD111 is investigational new biologics (Injection)--a type of lentiviral-like particle that can simultaneously deliver SpCas9 and gRNA targeting the HSV-1 virus gene, also known as HSV-1-erasing lentiviral particles (HELP). The total follow-up duration was 12 months, the safe endpoints and efficacy endpoints will be used to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles in patients with HSK."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Herpes Simplex Virus Type I Stromal Keratitis"],"keywords":["Herpes Simplex Virus Type I","Stromal Keratitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"BD111 combining triple-drugs therapy Group.","interventionNames":["Genetic: BD111 Injection (investigational new drug)","Combination Product: Triple-drugs therapy of HSV-1 stromal keratitis"]},{"label":"Group 2","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"BD111 sham injection combining triple-drugs therapy group.","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Triple-drugs therapy of HSV-1 stromal keratitis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"BD111 Injection (investigational new drug)","description":"BD111: intrastromally injection, single-dosing RP2D (TU/eye), specified injection volume is 0.15mL.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1"],"otherNames":["BD111 Lentivirus-like particles, also called HSV-1-erasing lentiviral particles (HELP)"]},{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"Triple-drugs therapy of HSV-1 stromal keratitis","description":"Triple-drugs therapy: \"Ganciclovir Eye gel+Valacilovir Tablets+Prednisolone Acetate Eye Drops\" for 3 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Group 1","Group 2"],"otherNames":["Ganciclovir Eye gel+Valacilovir Tablets+Prednisolone Acetate Eye Drops"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical cure rate of HSK at Day 70 and Day112 post-administration","description":"Definition of HSK clinical cure: disappearance of the subject's clinical symptoms, disappearance of active inflammatory lesions on ophthalmologic examinations, and successful clearance of the HSV-1 viral genome.","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The percentage of participants with successful clearance of HSV-1 viral genome in tears at Day 14, Day 28, Day 70, Day 112, Day 180, and Day 365 post-administration","description":"The definition of successful HSV-1 clearance: negative results in tear swab HSV-1 nucleic acid tests on two consecutive samplings (interval ≥14 days).\n\nThe definition of a negative result in tear swab HSV-1 nucleic acid test: single qPCR Ct value = 40 or \"undetected\", or Ct value of the first qPCR test \"36 \\< Ct value \\< 40\", and the Ct value of repetitive qPCR test is 40 or \"undetected\".","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"The percentage of participants with failed clearance of HSV-1 viral genome in tears at Day 14, Day 28, Day 70, Day 112, Day 180, and Day 365 post-administration","description":"The failure of HSV-1 viral genome clearance is determinated by HSV-1 positive results of qPCR test.
