The \"Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Gastrointestinal Diseases\" released in 2016 explicitly proposed that its essence is \"brain-gut interaction disorder\", and it is due to the bidirectional regulation of the brain-gut axis that the phenomenon of combined depression is common in FD patients induced by \"brain-gut interaction disorder\", which is prone to clinical underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, and also to clinical depression. It is easy to cause clinical underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, and also brings many challenges to drug treatment. It is feasible to use Zuojinwan combined with rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated capsules or Zuojinwan combined with mosapride citrate tablets for the treatment of FD combined with depression. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of Zuojinwan combined with rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated capsules or mosapride citrate for the treatment of FD combined with depression with that of rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated capsules or mosapride citrate treatment alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Functional Dyspepsia","Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets or mosapride citrate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For epigastric pain syndrome, Rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets were given as 20mg/dose, 2 times/day.\n\nPostprandial discomfort syndrome was treated with mosapride citrate, 5mg/dose, 3 times/day, orally before meals.\n\nThe treatment lasted for 4 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets","Drug: mosapride citrate"]},{"label":"Chinese medicine combination group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the Chinese medicine combination group, 3g of Zuojinwan was added to the western medicine group twice a day for 4 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: zuojinwan","Drug: Rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets","Drug: mosapride citrate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"zuojinwan","description":"In the Chinese medicine combination group, 3g of Zuojinwan was added to the western medicine group twice a day for 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Chinese medicine combination group"],"otherNames":["zuojin pills"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets","description":"For epigastric pain syndrome","armGroupLabels":["Chinese medicine combination group","rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets or mosapride citrate"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"mosapride citrate","description":"Postprandial discomfort syndrome","armGroupLabels":["Chinese medicine combination group","rabeprazole sodium enteric-coated tablets or mosapride citrate"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Depressionsymptom scale","description":"Hamilton Depression Scale is assessed patients' depressive symptoms pre- and post-treatment.","timeFrame":"Pre-treatment and 4 weeks of treatment"},{"measure":"FD symptom scale","description":"The overall score method for the main symptoms was used, and the overall symptoms included postprandial fullness and discomfort, early satiety, mid-upper abdominal pain, and burning sensation in the mid-upper abdomen.
