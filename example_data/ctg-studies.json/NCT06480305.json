This rhythm affects factors like body temperature, sleep and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Dietary choices influence these physiological processes of the body. Poor sleep quality can increase stress and raise levels of a hormone called cortisol, affecting our heart and insulin levels. Heart rate variability (HRV) which is the time between heartbeats, is also influenced by sleep and the body's rhythm. Lower HRV levels have been linked to heart and mental health issues. Little research is present on the effects of post-dinner snacks and pre-breakfast interventions on sleep quality, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), temperature, Interleukin-6, and cortisol levels. It is hypothesised that eating a post-dinner snack and first pre-breakfast will affect sleep quality, heart rate variability, IL -6, cortisol levels and temperature in healthy males.","detailedDescription":"The body's internal clock, circadian rhythms, works on a 24-hour cycle and is managed by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. These rhythms control various bodily functions like temperature, hunger, emotions, and even our sleep-wake cycle. During sleep, hormones like cortisol, growth hormone, and insulin influence processes such as glucose metabolism. For instance, insulin levels drop while we sleep to allow the body to use stored energy, but rise again before waking. Poor sleep quality, even with adequate duration, can lead to increased stress and elevated cortisol levels, potentially affecting insulin and heart health. Heart rate variability (HRV), is the variation in time between heartbeats and is influenced by factors like stress, diet, and sleep quality. Lower HRV levels are associated with cardiovascular and mental health issues. Disruptions in the circadian sleep cycle can also affect the gut-brain axis, which involves communication between the gut and the brain via the vagus nerve. This axis influences gastrointestinal function and can impact inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 (IL-6), which in turn affect HRV and cardiovascular health. Dietary choices play a significant role in shaping the body's physiological processes. Nuts can positively impact HRV and sleep quality due to their nutrient content. A post-dinner snack consumed about three hours after dinner and a balanced pre-breakfast meal is important for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and overall health. Nuts, such as peanuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, and walnuts, along with raisins, offer numerous health benefits. These contain fibre, protein, healthy fats, and essential nutrients that promote satiety, metabolic well-being, and digestive health. Thus this research aims to investigate the effects of post-dinner snacks and pre-breakfast interventions on HRV, sleep quality, IL-6, cortisol, and temperature. By exploring the relationship between dietary choices and physiological processes, we hope to gain insight into how to optimize health and well-being.\n\nThe participation will go through 2 assessments; at baseline and after intervention. For comparison two-way ANOVA followed by Post hoc-Tuckey test and for correlation between HRV and other parameters will be done using Pearson Correlation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Circadian Rhythm"],"keywords":["sleep","Heart Rate Variability","stress","cortisol","Interleukin-6","post dinner snack","prebreakfast","nuts"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pre-breakfast and post dinner snack (A1)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The Group A1 participants will not receive anything except for consuming a post-dinner snack.
