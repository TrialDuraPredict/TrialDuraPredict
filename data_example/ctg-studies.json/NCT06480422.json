It is a preventable and treatable lung disease. People with COPD must work harder to breathe, which can lead to shortness of breath and/or feeling tired. Autogenic drainage (AD) works by adapting your breathing and maximizing airflow within the airways to improve ventilation and clear sputum. Segmental breathing, also referred to as localized expansion breathing, is the exercise used to improve ventilation and oxygenation. This research of randomized controlled trial will check the combined effects of segmental breathing technique and autogenic drainage technique in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by taking sample of 40 patients through non probability convenient sampling and randomly allocating them into two groups A and B out of which A will receive both autogenic drainage and segmental breathing technique, B will receive autogenic drainage only for upto the duration of 3 days per week(20-45 min) for upto 4 weeks.Pre and post training outcomes will be measured through pulse oximeter,spirometer and BCSS.The data will be analyzed through SPSS 25."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"],"keywords":["Autogenic Drainage,","Segmental breathing technique","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"segmental breathing technique + Autogenic drainage","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"For Segmental Breathing instruction, the therapist's hand is placed on the chest area to be expanded.

It assesses the capacity of the lungs to breathe in and out, especially the volume and/or velocity of air that can be expelled.

An FEV1/FVC ratio larger than 0.70 with both FEV1 and FVC over 80% of the expected value are considered normal spirometry data.
