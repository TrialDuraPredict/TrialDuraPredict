Although obese children may benefit more from lung protective ventilation, there are few studies on the use of lung protective ventilation strategies in obese children during surgery. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that intraoperative use of LPV strategies in obese pediatric surgery patients can reduce atelectasis and improve the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.","detailedDescription":"In the lung protective ventilation group, PEEP was titrated individually in a sequential manner after mechanical ventilation. According to previous studies, PEEP was 5 cmH2O, inspiratory pressure was 20 cmH2O, and respiratory rate was set according to patient age. PEEP and inspiratory pressure were increased by 5 cmH2O every 30 seconds until PEEP was 15 cmH2O and inspiratory pressure 30 cmH2O. This was followed by a decreasing amplitude of 2 cmH2O to 3 cmH2O starting from 15 cmH2O, and each PEEP level was maintained for 4 to 5 respiratory cycles.The PEEP was at the lowest driving pressure was applied throughout the procedure. The PEEP level resulting in the lowest driving pressure was applied during surgery. In the traditional mechanical ventilation group, a fixed PEEP of 5 cm H2O was applied. The investigators compared the incidence of postoperative atelectasis between the two groups using lung ultrasound."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Driving Pressure","Positive End-expiratory Pressure","Postoperative Atelectasis","Obese"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Lung protective ventilation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"PEEP was titrated individually in a sequential manner after mechanical ventilation.
