Strategies to increase appetite are needed to improve healthy ageing. This study follows on from previous work which has found a novel ingredient in whey protein (derived from whole milk) that may help to increase appetite and energy intake. This study will compare the effects of the ingredient added to an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) versus the ONS alone versus the ingredient dissolved in water on appetite in older adults. By studying this nutrition supplement in older adults, this will help to provide greater information on possible nutrition strategies to improve healthy ageing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aging","Appetite Loss","Undernutrition"],"keywords":["Appetite","Poor Appetite","Ageing","Whey protein hydrolysate","Visual analogue scale","Energy intake","Ghrelin","Oral Nutritional Supplement","Dairy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"Crossover Assignment\n\nAll participants undertake all three experimental conditions in a random order.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Out of three treatments, one of the investigators is blinded for all treatments while the other is not blinded.\n\nThe participant is fully blinded, i.e. treatments will be served in generic containers for Oral Nutritional Supplement (unlabelled) and vanilla-flavoured.","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Oral Nutritional Supplement","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"125 mL of commercially available of Oral Nutritional Supplement, a liquid food product containing vitamins, minerals, protein, fats and carbohydrates. 125 mL of product provides 37.0 g of carbohydrates, 11.6 g of fats, 12.0 g of proteins, vitamins and minerals.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Oral Nutritional Supplement"]},{"label":"Oral Nutritional Supplement + Whey Protein Hydrolysate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2,2 grams of whey protein hydrolysate dissolved in 125 mL of commercially available of Oral Nutritional Supplement","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Oral Nutritional Supplement + Whey Protein Hydrolysate"]},{"label":"Whey Protein Hydrolysate","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"2,2 grams of whey protein hydrolysate dissolved in 125 mL of water","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Whey Protein Hydrolysate + still water"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Oral Nutritional Supplement","description":"Commercially available Oral Nutritional Supplement alone consumed 90 minutes prior to an ad libitum breakfast","armGroupLabels":["Oral Nutritional Supplement"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Oral Nutritional Supplement + Whey Protein Hydrolysate","description":"Whey Protein Hydrolysate dissolved in an Oral Nutritional Supplement consumed 90 minutes prior to an ad libitum breakfast","armGroupLabels":["Oral Nutritional Supplement + Whey Protein Hydrolysate"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Whey Protein Hydrolysate + still water","description":"Whey Protein Hydrolysate dissolved in still water consumed 90 minutes prior to an ad libitum breakfast","armGroupLabels":["Whey Protein Hydrolysate"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pre-meal and changes in Hunger","description":"Validated 100-millimetre Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) will be used to assess hunger, at ten (10) set time points throughout the experimental visit.
