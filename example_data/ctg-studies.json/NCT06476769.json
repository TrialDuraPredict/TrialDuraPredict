Age of selected subjects will be between 40 to 70 years. Data will be collected from Wazirabad institute of cardiology. There will be 2 groups i.e. group A will receive combination of blow bottle technique and postural drainage and group B will receive postural drainage. Spirometer will be used to evaluate pulmonary functions and breathless, cough and sputum scale (BCSS) will be used to evaluate the improvement in sputum diary of patients. Interventions will be given to the patients for 20-25 minutes twice a day for 6 days per week. After data collection, data will be analyzed using SPSS version 25."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"],"keywords":["Dyspnea","Postural drainage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"blow bottle technique","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"There were 20 patients in group A received blow bottle device and postural drainage for 20- 25 minutes per session twice a day for 4 days per week, for 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: blow bottle technique"]},{"label":"percussion","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"There were 20 patients in group B received postural drainage with percussion for 20- 25 minutes per session twice a day for 4 days per week, for 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: percussion"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"blow bottle technique","description":"There were 20 patients in group A received blow bottle device and postural drainage for 20- 25 minutes per session twice a day for 4 days per week, for 8 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["blow bottle technique"],"otherNames":["postural drainage"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"percussion","description":"Group B: There were 20 patients in group B received postural drainage with percussion for 20- 25 minutes per session twice a day for 4 days per week, for 8 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["percussion"],"otherNames":["postural drainage"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Breathlessness cough sputum scale","description":"Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum scale (BCSS) was developed to effectively measure the severity of respiratory symptoms. The BCSS records symptoms in a 5-point Likert like scale in which zero represents improvement symptoms and scores towards 4 indicating worsening of symptoms. It is commonly used in patients with COPD. BCSS provides a simple and robust quantification of symptoms that is sensitive to the effects of treatment and could therefore be used to assess therapeutic interventions. It has good reliability and validity for use in patients with respiratory disorders.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Modified borg RPE scale:","description":"The Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale (MBS) is rated numerical score used to measure dyspnea as reported by the patient during submaximal exercise, one of the most common and frequently used measures to assess the severity of dyspnea.","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Incentive spirometry","description":"Incentive spirometry is frequently used after thoracic surgery as an adjunct to physiotherapy.
