Current exercise guidelines are inadequate to ameliorate this risk and higher intensity exercise may be necessary for cardiovascular benefits in postmenopausal females. Oral nitrate supplementation enhances exercise performance and CVD risk profile in several clinical conditions. The investigators recently reported that 3-days of nitrate supplementation in postmenopausal females enhances acute post-exercise vascular function, in an intensity dependent manner. The effects of nitrate supplementation and exercise training over a longer training program remains unexplored. This investigation will examine the impact of exercise training intensity with and without inorganic nitrate supplementation, on CVD and fitness outcomes. Postmenopausal females will be tested for maximal oxygen uptake and lactate threshold before randomization to one of four groups: that inorganic nitrate-rich tablets, or tablets with nitrate extracted; and assigned to one-month of calorie matched high-intensity or moderate-intensity exercise training. Vascular function and fitness will be evaluated before and after training."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Menopause"],"keywords":["Inorganic Nitrate","Menopause","High Intensity Exercise","Vascular Health"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Subjects will be randomized to one-month of either high or moderate aerobic exercise training and then further randomized to nitrate or placebo.","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"A study team member not associated with the trial will perform the randomization scheme for the supplementation.
