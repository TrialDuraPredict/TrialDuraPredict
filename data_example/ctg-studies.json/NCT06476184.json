The randomization will be stratified on the main clinical prognostic factors assumed to impact the efficacy of the assessed arms and the overall survival:\n\n1. Bevacizumab: planned administration: Yes, vs No\n2. BRCA mutation: planned administration: Yes, vs No/Unknown\n3. KELIMTM strate within unfavorable KELIM subgroup: very unfavorable \\< 0.7, vs moderately unfavorable \\[0.7-1.0\\[\n\nThe trial will be pragmatic, as it aims at confirming the superiority of the adjusted chemotherapy compared to the continuation of the standard chemotherapy in routine clinical practice, in a population of ovarian cancer patients close to the real-life clinical activity with
