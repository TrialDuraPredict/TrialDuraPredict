Hypertension has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and dyslipidaemia and is directly linked to mortality caused by coronary artery disease.\n\nModerate Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) has been recognised as the gold standard for many years. However, for some time, different researchers have adopted the high-intensity interval training model (HIIT) as the most effective method in terms of objective adaptations of most cardiac rehabilitation programmes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure.\n\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of cycles between warm-up and cool-down periods, high-intensity exercise intensity followed by an active recovery period. The duration and intensity of these cycles vary between studies and there is no consensus on which is the optimal cycle. In general, the high-intensity exercise phase is applied at 80-100% of VO2 max and the active recovery phase is used between 50-70% of VO2 max.\n\nIn Moderate Intensity Continuous Training the submaximal exercise intensity determined in accordance with the patient's functional capacity between the warm-up and cool-down periods is applied for a fixed period. The Moderate Intensity Continuous Training is planned to consist of 20-30 minute sessions between 50-70% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Heart Disease","Quality of Life","Functional Capacity","Fatigue"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":78,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Moderate Intensity Continuous Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* A total of 24 -30 (8-10 weeks) sessions of an exercise-based Cardio Rehabilitation program 3 days a week.\n* Cycling for 20-30 minutes at 50-70% of Wmax between warm-up and cool-down periods.","interventionNames":["Other: Cardio Rehabilitation program","Other: Cycling for 20-30 minutes"]},{"label":"High-intensity interval training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* A total of 24 -30 (8-10 weeks) sessions of an exercise-based Cardiac Rehabilitation program 3 days a week.\n* Cycling a total of 4 cycles consisting of 4 minutes at 85-100% of Wmax followed by 3 minutes of active recovery periods at 50-70% of Wmax between warm-up and cool-down periods.","interventionNames":["Other: Cardio Rehabilitation program","Other: Cycling a total of 4 cycles"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cardio Rehabilitation program","description":"A total of 24 30 (8-10 weeks) sessions of an exercise-based Cardio Rehabilitation program 3 days a week.","armGroupLabels":["High-intensity interval training","Moderate Intensity Continuous Training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cycling for 20-30 minutes","description":"Cycling for 20-30 minutes at 50-70% of Wmax between warm-up and cool-down periods.","armGroupLabels":["Moderate Intensity Continuous Training"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Cycling a total of 4 cycles","description":"Cycling a total of 4 cycles consisting of 4 minutes at 85-100% of Wmax followed by 3 minutes of active recovery periods at 50-70% of Wmax between warm-up and cool-down periods.","armGroupLabels":["High-intensity interval training"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) - Heart Rate Recovery","description":"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is performed on patients with a bicycle ergometer, including analysis of exhaled gases. The testing protocol is tailored to the physical condition of each patient in gradual increments of 10, 15 or 20 W/min. The same protocol is used before and after the exercise training programme. The aim of exercise testing is to obtain a sustained effort for 8 to 12 minutes in order to maintain favourable oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics and a linear relationship between VO2, exercise workload and heart rate (HR). A 12-lead ECG is continuously monitored and blood pressure is measured every 3 min during exercise tests. Resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, maximum load (watts), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, VO2 max and/or VO2 estimate, HRR-1 and HRR-2 values are recorded before and after treatment as CPET data.
