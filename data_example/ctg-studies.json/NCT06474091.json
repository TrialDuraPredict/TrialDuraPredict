To estimate the association of PUMA levels from peripheral blood with disease progression (radiographically or clinically) in patients that are candidates for curative surgical intervention of cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nIa. Pre- and post-neoadjuvant-treatment PUMA levels will be associated with treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy (short term progression).\n\nIb. Pre-surgical and post-surgical PUMA levels will be associated with progression free survival.\n\nII. To estimate the association of PUMA levels from peripheral blood with postoperative survival in patients treated for cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood samples and have their medical records reviewed on study. Patients also undergo collection of archived tissue samples on study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cholangiocarcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational","description":"Patients undergo collection of blood samples and have their medical records reviewed on study.
