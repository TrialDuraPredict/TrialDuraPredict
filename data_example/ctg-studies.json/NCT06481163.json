Males and females age 18 and older will be included.\n\n* Participants will attend visits every week during treatment (4 weeks)\n* Thereafter they will be followed every 2 weeks until week 24 followed by visits as weeks 30, 40 and 52.\n* Dependent on site requirements, there may be follow up visits on site or remotely.","detailedDescription":"This is an open label single arm (telacebec), multi-centre, clinical trial. Eligible participants with clinically diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) category I lesions and category II lesions ≤10 cm cross-sectional diameter and category III lesions where multiple and all lesions are ≤10 cm cross-sectional diameter, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture for presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, will receive telacebec 300 mg orally once daily for 28 days with food.\n\nParticipants who meet entry criteria and give consent will attend a baseline enrolment visit (Day 1), then visits every week for 4 weeks during treatment (weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4). Thereafter they will be followed up every 2 weeks until week 24, followed by visits at weeks 30, 40, and 52.\n\nBU lesion management will be provided to all trial participants. In case of participant early withdrawal from the trial during or after the treatment period, participants will be treated per the investigational site and/or country BU treatment guidelines.\n\nA Data Review Committee (DRC) will be established to review efficacy and safety data. Enrolment and enrolled participants will continue the study whilst the DRC reviews are ongoing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Buruli Ulcer"],"keywords":["lesion","ulcer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open Label","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"300 mg Telacebec per day","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Telacebec will be administered orally with food or within 30 minutes after food once daily for 28 consecutive days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Telacebec"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Telacebec","description":"The test product will be supplied as Telacebec 100mg tablets.","armGroupLabels":["300 mg Telacebec per day"],"otherNames":["Q203"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Rate of complete lesion healing by 52 weeks from treatment initiation.","description":"Ulcerated Lesions: Healing and re-epithelialisation of ulcerated area with stable scar formation.
