So far, there is no standardized and specific clinical therapy for SPG56. The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the efficacy and safety of calcium folinate in the treatment of SPG56 patients.\n\nThis study is prospective, open-label and single arm and this trial will last for 6 years. A total of 10 patients will participate and they will receive calcium folinate treatment and professional clinical evaluation regularly."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"calcium folinate treatment group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Drug: calcium folinate Phase I: calcium folinate infusion intravenously for 5 consecutive days at a dose of 1mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day.
