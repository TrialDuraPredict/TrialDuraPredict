NCT06473402,"Flexibility is the ability of the muscle to move in a single or a series of joint planes within an unrestricted range of motion. Muscle flexibility is an important element of muscle functionality and has a very important place in ensuring the biomechanical function of the muscle. One of the advantages of flexibility in the context of literature is its ability to enhance athletic performance, decrease the likelihood of injury, alleviate or minimize post-exercise discomfort, and improve coordination. Furthermore, it serves as a crucial aspect for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Limited flexibility causes the person to be prone to various musculoskeletal system overuse injuries and significantly affects functionality. Flexibility is different for each muscle. This difference depends on the adaptation of the muscle to the stresses placed on the muscle. Decreased flexibility is usually seen in fast-twitch muscles that span two joints. Hamstring muscles are a typical example of this. In normal daily activities, the physiological amplitudes of the hamstring muscles are rarely fully realized. For this reason, hamstring muscles are one of the muscle groups that tend to shorten. Hamstring shortness occurs in almost all populations worldwide, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The causes of hamstring shortness include genetic factors, adaptation of the muscle to acute or chronic injury, sitting in a sitting position for a long time, etc. countable. Some studies have stated that decreased hamstring flexibility may cause patellar tendinopathy, patellofemoral pain, hamstring strain, and muscle damage after eccentric exercise.Therefore, the flexibility of the hamstring muscles must be maintained. Flexible hamstrings can prevent acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries, low back pain, posture deviations, gait limitations and the risk of falls. Stretching exercises are often performed to increase hamstring flexibility . There are also different methods to increase hamstring flexibility. A widely used approach is manual therapy. According to Greenman, this method can strengthen weak muscles by restoring their normal length when they are shortened, contracted, or affected by spasticity. In addition, manual therapy can help reduce edema by promoting the lymphatic system's pumping action. This approach also enhances the mobility of joints with limited movement.

Another alternative method is massage application. Massage is believed to increase blood flow to the muscles and increase muscle temperature, thus improving performance. In addition to the effects mentioned above, massage is believed to reduce the risk of injury by increasing flexibility and reducing stiffness.

The rate of use of massage guns has increased significantly, especially in recent years, by athletes, coaches and physiotherapists. Perhaps the most important reasons why it is so popular are that it helps to increase sports performance and increase the level of flexibility. According to the literature, applying the sacroiliac joint muscle energy technique and percussion massage to the hamstring muscle has been shown to increase hamstring flexibility. However, there is no study available that compares the immediate effects of applying the sacroiliac joint muscle energy technique versus percussion massage on hamstring shortness. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare the instant effects of sacroiliac joint muscle energy technique and percussion massage applications on hamstring flexibility.",0.6333333333333333

NCT06470724,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a brain development disorder marked by issues in two main areas: communication and interacting with others; as well as rigid, repetitive, and stereotypical behaviors, hobbies, or activities. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is becoming more common every year, making it a major concern for most parents around the world, including those in Indonesia. One of the areas in Indonesia, Yogyakarta, also has to deal with this problem.

Studies have shown that a lot of kids with autism are afraid of things that don't make sense. Sensory issues are common in kids with ASD, which makes it hard for them to handle the sounds and sights in the dentist's office. As a result, these kids often show more behavioral problems, too much worry, and bad behavior at the dentist's office, which makes it very hard for the dentists to do exams and provide oral care. Researchers also think that this refusal to cooperate makes parents hesitant to take their autistic children to the dentist for regular checkups or treatments. This means that these kids don't get the dental care they need and have bad mouth health. Also, many studies show that kids with ASD are more likely than kids in the general population to have cavities, bad oral health, and periodontal disease.

To help people with behavior problems, you need to know about their other health problems, the type of ASD they have, any previous treatment they've had, their behavior, their social and communication skills, the medicines they take to control their behavior, any learning disabilities or mental retardation they may have, their heightened sensory perceptions, and their inability to apply what they have learned in other situations.

Notably, visual pedagogy is a structural-visual behavior method that is often used with kids who have ASD. People in Indonesia have looked into how to help kids with autism understand dental checks by using visual aids. However, these tests were not done in real centers with lots of kids and long wait times. With this and other reasons in mind, this study used a visual-structural method to help Indonesian kids with autism during dental checks. What they learned about kids and their families led them to make changes. The information can help dentists handle kids with ASD and guess how they will act during dental exams.

The intervention comprised seven behavior approaches in this research defined as follows:

A successive approach: An approach to familiarization with the unfamiliar environment of the simulated dental office.

Tell-Feel-Show-Do (T-F-S-D): A dental approach explained to the patient's treatment by telling the patient what would happen, what he felt or did, and what had been done.

Visual pedagogy: Introduced dentistry to autistic children through visual media, such as pictures and photographs.

Audiovisual modeling: A learning process through audiovisual media, such as video and animation.

In-vivo modeling: Learning new activities by watching them in front of the model.

Behavioral trials: A learning strategy conducted through practicing the recent activity by him/herself.

Auto-modeling: A learning process following the activity of editing pictures during the prior visit of the patient.",6.7
NCT06470464,"Thalidomide (THD) is currently widely used in the treatment of immune rheumatic diseases, blood tumors and solid tumors. Solid tumors are mostly used in the treatment of lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., and are limited to patients with advanced or advanced tumors. The main mechanisms of its action are inhibition of angiogenesis, immune regulation, induction of apoptosis, target teratogenesis and so on. However, whether from animal experiments or clinical studies, thalidomide alone or in combination with chemotherapy has not been seen to have a very effective therapeutic effect or exact clinical application in the treatment of these solid tumors.

According to the latest relevant case analysis reports and clinical trial results abroad, TIP regimen is still the priority recommended treatment regimen in the previous data for children with recurrent and refractory malignant germ cell tumors. However, the combination of Sirolimus and TIC regimen (nab-paclitaxel + isocyclophosphamide + carboplatin) previously explored by our research group can greatly improve the remission rate of recurrent and refractory germinal cell tumors, especially for recurrent and refractory yolk sac tumors, a certain proportion can be cured or the opportunity for surgery and radiotherapy can be obtained to achieve cure. However, there are still some children who are insensitive or progress again after 2 cycles of remission. For these children with multiple relapsed or particularly difficult yolk sac tumors, there is no effective treatment plan in the world at present, and there is no relevant clinical trial. However, through our clinical experience and understanding in the treatment process of these children, The results of thalidomide combined with TGA chemotherapy regimen (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + epirubicin) were satisfactory. Therefore, we hope to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reactions of this regimen through clinical trials, so as to provide an effective treatment option for children with recurrent and refractory yolk sac tumor.

NCT06478511,"Patient's selection:

Patients in this study will be selected from the outpatient clinic of Oral Medicine and Periodontology department, Faculty of Dentistry, Mansoura University.

Patients participating in this study will sign an informed consent demonstrating the purpose of this study, treatment procedure, probable risks and benefits from this treatment procedure. The study proposal will be reviewed by the faculty's Research Ethics Committee.

All the selected patients will receive full mouth scaling, preoperative periapical x-ray and cone beam computed.

Surgical procedures:

Before surgery, Preoperative antibiotics will be given orally one hour prior to surgery (amoxicillin, 2g, or clindamycin, 600 mg, for patients allergic to penicillin) the patients will be advised to rinse for one minute with chlorhexidiene mouthwash. After local anesthesia administration, In group 1, the teeth will be extracted gently using periotomes, in an attempt to preserve facial and lingual bone plates. The sockets will be debrided of soft tissue and irrigated. Then all walls of the socket will be inspected and checked for the presence of fenestration or dehiscence defects in bone. The length and width of extracted roots will be measured to determine the length and diameter of implants placed. The osteotomy sites will be prepared and the drills will be used in proper sequence according to manufacturer's instructions, with maximum use of bone apical to the extraction sockets. The drills will extend 3 to 5 mm beyond the apex of the socket to ensure primary stability after placement, taking care of the anatomical boundaries. After the osteotomy sites had been prepared, the implants will be placed.

In group 2, concerning the donor site of the connective tissue, connective tissue graft was harvested from palate using trap door technique (27) utilizing a horizontal incision 3-4 mm away from the gingival margin with two vertical incisions on the either end of the first incision, creating a door, the door is then undermined and opened using a sharp dissection, the underlying connective tissue is then harvested using a periosteal elevator, and the door was then sutured using 4 0 silk sutures Finally, the connective tissue graft was immediately placed into the recipient site after a tunneling procedure and sutured with 6-0 nonresorbable monofilament sutures.

In group 3, the crown of the involved tooth will be removed and the root will be then sectioned in a mesiodistal direction along its long axis as far apical as was possible using a long shank fissure bur coupled to a hydrated high-speed handpiece. Sectioning will divide the tooth root into facial and palatal halves with the intention of preserving the facial root section unmanipulated and attached to the tooth socket. Periotomes will be then inserted between the palatal root section and the alveolar socket wall to sever the PDL and this section of root will be then carefully delivered with so as not to disturb the facial root section.

The remaining root section will be then reduced coronally to 1 mm above the alveolar crest, and will be thinned slightly to a concave contour by careful application in an apico-coronal and mesiodistal direction with a long shanked round diamond. The tooth socket's palatal wall and apex will be then curetted to remove any tissue or infective remnants and the root section will be checked for immobility with a sharp probe. With the preparation steps complete, the tooth root hereafter will be known as the socket-shield. An osteotomy will be then sequentially prepared and internal conical connection implant was inserted palatal to the socket shield with the implant 2 mm below the facial crest.

Immediate temporary dentures were fabricated using plastic and inserted on the day of implantation. Patients were instructed to consume soft food for eight weeks. Following a healing period of 6 months, the final restorations will be delivered.",33.63333333333333

NCT06478615,"Fistula-in-ano is a common medical problem affecting thousands of patients annually. Symptoms generally affect quality of life significantly, and they range from minor discomfort and drainage with resultant hygienic problems to sepsis. Different classifications have been put forward which categorize these Fistula into low or high simple or complex, or according to their anatomy inter-sphincteric, trans-sphincteric, and supra- sphincteric or extra-sphincteric.

Conventional laying-open technique in high perianal fistula may involve sacrifice of part or whole of the sphincter muscle impairing continence. A transposition technique for the management of high anal and anorectal fistulae is described by Mann and Clifton in 1985. The method involves re-routing the extrasphincteric portion of the track into an intersphincteric position with immediate repair of the external sphincter.

Coring-out fistulectomy is a type of sphincter-preserving procedure that enables accurate resection of the fistula tract alone and thus reduces the possibility of missing a secondary tract",15.233333333333333

NCT06478914,"Burned patients experience various problems, including skin damage, vascular damage, and metabolic stress. These injuries can lead to peripheral neuropathies, which can affect nerve function and cause weakness or lack of sensation. Lymphatic damage can delay wound healing, causing contractures that affect the patient's physical function. Burn-Associated polyneuropathy (BAPN) is common after thermal injury, affecting nerve function. Electrophysiological assessments of muscle and nerves are essential in neurology, physical therapy, and related clinical disciplines. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is used to increase force output, strengthen muscles, and control pain. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) is used to treat chronic inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, improving absorption of fluid, secretion of macrophage growth factors, DNA synthesis, pain reduction, and electron respiratory chain reaction. However, the effect of LILT on scar formation and treatment of fibrosis or calcification secondary to hematomas or fat necrosis is not yet evaluated.

NCT06473727,"Colour selection for composite restorations is a challenging process influenced by a number of environmental and operator factors. The polychromatic structure of natural teeth presents a challenge to shade selection. Consequently, the prevailing trend towards simplification of shade matching has led to the emergence of single-shade universal composites. Single-shade universal composites are able to replicate the natural colour of teeth by capturing the structural colour based on the size of the filler particles. Unlike other materials, it does not require the use of additional dyes or pigments. The blending, colour induction and colour assimilation effects of resin composites are collectively referred to as the chameleon effect. This phenomenon allows resin-based restorative materials to achieve a shade that closely resembles the colour of the surrounding tooth structure. The intelligent monochromatic composite makes shade selection easier for the clinician and provides a quick and easy way to create aesthetic restorations. Its distinctive character reduces confusion and potentially saves time in the clinic. However, the effectiveness of this material in matching different shades of natural teeth remains uncertain, and there is a paucity of clinical evidence on the efficacy of its colour-matching capabilities in dental restorations.",11.933333333333334

NCT06479733,"Soft tissue grafting around dental implants has been recommended to enhance functional, biological, and esthetic outcomes. As a thick peri-implant mucosa is of importance to prevent recession, color alterations, bone remodeling and promote ""creeping attachment"". Two major indications include the increase of the KM width and the increase of soft tissue volume using autogenous or alternative type grafts.

Several techniques have been proposed to augment the volume of the mucosa to achieve the so-called pink esthetics: connective tissue grafts, lyophilized allogenic soft tissue grafts, porcine collagen matrix, free gingival grafts, a combination of grafting and vestibuloplasty, strip gingival autografts, tissue engineered fibroblasts, allograft, collagen matrices, and the use of the buccal pedicle flap.

Among surgical techniques, the proposed modified buccal pedicle flap was demonstrated to perform well in terms of decreased morbidity, maintenance of blood supply, stabilization of the pedicle, superior haemostasis, and speed of treatment. However, a possible drawback may be related to the original thickness of the flap since a thin mucosa phenotype may be more prompt to perforation when in contact with a cross-linked collagen matrix.

The autologous subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is generally regarded as the gold standard for soft tissue augmentation around natural teeth and dental implants. However, harvesting an autologous soft tissue graft necessarily entails additional preoperative preparation, a second surgical site, longer operative duration, and increased morbidity, regardless of the surgical technique employed and the expertise of the operator.

Another alternative for autogenous grafting is the acellular dermal matrix (ADM) allograft that is derived from human skin. ADM, originally used for treating burn wounds , is an epithelium free, freeze-dried matrix containing types I and III collagen bundles where elastic fibers are its main components . ADM acts as a bioactive scaffold that integrates in host tissue and permits the migration of fibroblasts and epithelial and endothelial cells through vascular channels of the recipient sites . Since its initial use, ADM has been widely used in dental practice, in particular for soft tissue grafting of gingival recession or to change the quality of peri-implant/teeth mucosa.",11.633333333333333

NCT06476990,"Food Rx + CHW is a 3-month community health worker led medically tailored grocery intervention for patients with self-reported food insecurity and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at one academic medical center in the Midwest United States. Prior to contact and recruitment, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 12 weekly food deliveries and support from a CHW (Food + CHW group) or food deliveries only (Food-only group).

All participants receive 12 weekly contactless deliveries of food. CHWs conduct three virtual study visits with participants to administer surveys and/or collect biomarker measurements at weeks 1, 12, and 24. No changes in the frequency of visits with the patient's provider are recommended. Virtual visit 1 involves the completion of study forms, assessment of household size for most meals, cultural preferences, food allergies, baseline cooking and eating habits, and assessment for knowledge and usage of local and/or federal food support programs. At week 12, participants use at home kits and devices (provided by the study) to measure and report their HbA1C, weight and blood pressure and complete post-intervention surveys on diet, knowledge and usage of food access programs and resources, and an anonymous feedback questionnaire on the strengths and opportunities for improvement in the program. At week 24, participants measured and reported their final HbA1C, weight and self-collected blood pressure result.

In addition to food, participants in the Food + CHW group also received 7 weekly virtual sessions with a CHW (four 90-minute ZOOM counseling sessions and three 30 to 60-minute check-in phone calls). CHW sessions included diabetes-appropriate cooking and nutrition education and personalized benefit enrollment and linkage to existing food access resources (for example Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Double up Food Bucks, and Kansas Senior Farmers Market Vouchers).

Each weekly food box contained approximately $8 worth of shelf-stable food items purchased from a local food bank (beans, canned vegetables and no-sugar added fruit, shelf-stable dairy products, canned tuna, and whole grains) and $25 of fresh produce (5-7 items including leafy greens, peppers, potatoes, broccoli, carrots, zucchini, cauliflower, celery, cabbage, asparagus, apples, or strawberries). When seasonably available, fresh vegetables and fruit were sourced from local farmers via a local food hub. When local produce was not available, CHWs sourced produce from grocery stores.",11.8

NCT06476522,"Background:

Colon cancer (CC) is the third most diagnosed type of cancer worldwide. The age of onset varies between 50-75 years . Control of risk factors and early detection and its precursors through screening have an important role in reducing the incidence and mortality of CC. This means that the number of people living with and undergoing treatment for CC is growing.

One of the common treatment of CC is chemotherapy. It is known that chemotherapy can cause severe adverse effects that can be highly detrimental to a patient both physiologically and psychologically, thus having a large impact on an individual's quality of life (QoL). The most common and severe of these adverse effects are peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue . In addition, liver and kidney dysfunctions are seen in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Depending on the chemotherapy-related toxicity, side effects such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occur in patients. For this reason, regular blood tests of the patients during the chemotherapy process and their blood values were followed.

Studies examining the effect of exercise on the side effects of chemotherapy in colon and rectal cancer have found strong evidence for short-term improvements. There are various studies investigating the effects of exercises performed during chemotherapy on QoL, fatigue, and aerobic capacity in patients with CC. However, the duration and content of exercise programs in these studies are quite limited. No study was examined the effects of a home-based physiotherapy and recommendation program during 12-weeks chemotherapy treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of physiotherapy program on toxicity, muscle strength, balance, and endurance in patients undergoing chemotherapy in patients with CC.",2.033333333333333

NCT06474598,"MTX228 was developed as a treatment for gastric ulcers but did not advance beyond phase 2 clinical trials because of lack of efficacy. Subsequently, MTX228 has been identified as an activator of Lyn kinase and was considered as a treatment for type 2 diabetes as an insulin sensitizer because of Lyn's interaction with insulin signaling molecules. More recently, Lyn has been identified as a critical regulator of beta-cell mass, with genetic and biochemical inactivation of Lyn provoking beta-cell death in isolated human islets and precipitated diabetes in mice, and activation of Lyn stimulating beta-cell survival and beta-cell proliferation. These findings strongly suggest that small molecule activators of Lyn, such as MTX228, could represent new therapeutic options to promote beta-cell regeneration in type 1 diabetes.

MTX228 has not been testing in clinical studies in type 1 diabetes and the optimal dose to use is not clear from the clinical trial in type 2 diabetes, where lower doses (100 mg once or twice daily) were more effective than higher doses (200 mg once or twice daily).

The purpose of this study is to try to figure out the safety of an experimental treatment for melanoma. The experimental treatment is made up of focused ultrasound ablation (FUSA) and an injection in the tumor (intratumoral injection) with an experimental drug called polyICLC (also known as Hiltinol) that activates the immune system. The researchers also want to use the results from this clinical trial to help understand how the FUSA and polyICLC affect the tumor cells at the place where the FUSA is given and how much of the surrounding tumor is affected. The experimental treatment in this study is given at the University of Virginia Medical Center about three weeks before the melanoma tumor surgery that would occur as part of the participant's regular care.

FUSA is a non-invasive experimental treatment that uses ultrasound waves to heat and destroy tumor tissue. FUSA is administered using an investigational device. There are two models of the investigational device (EchopulseÂ® or the Echopulse HDÂ®) that will be used in the study to deliver the FUSA.

NCT06472323,"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), characterized by brief, recurrent paroxysms of lancinating pain in the distribution of 1 or more branches of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve \[CNV\]), is one of the most common, severe forms of neuropathic pain. Current standard of care for TN is the sodium channel blockers such as carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Surgical treatments involve percutaneous procedures, stereotactic radiosurgery and open surgical treatment. Each of these treatments have drawback. In recent years, pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) has been shown to be a promising treatment option for TN. But it was reported that the long-term outcomes of PRF was not satisfactory. Thus, there is an overwhelming need for finding a safe, nondestructive treatment option that is more effective for TN. PRP releases a variety of bioactive factors and adhesion proteins, which are responsible for activating hemostatic cascade reaction, synthesizing new connective tissue and vascular reconstruction, to initiate tissue repair processes. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is the processed liquid fraction of autologous peripheral blood with a platelet concentration above the baseline. Studies have shown that it can reduce inflammation and promote nerve repair so it has also shown broad prospects in treating neuropathic pain. In 2012, Doss AX. published a case report indicated that PRP might be effective in TN treatment. In 2023, a randomized controlled study showed that CT-guided PRF combined with PRP can effectively treat postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and the therapeutic effect is better than that of traditional PRF combined with glucocorticoid therapy in patients with PHN, which is similar to TN in pathology. Thus, we suppose that PRF combined with PRP might show better effectiveness than PRF alone for TN and conducted a prospective trail comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of PRP combined with PRF versus PRF alone.

Note: Subject is considered enrolled, if subject meets initial eligibility criteria and is randomized to a treatment arm.

Study Duration for Subjects:

Total study duration for individual subject will be about 4 months, which includes a 3-week Screening period, 10 days pretreatmentperiod, treatment day, and a 12-week post-treatment period.

Overall Study Design:

This randomized clinical trial will include male and female subjects â‰¥40 years of age, with known history of T2DM and symptomatic unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee. Eligible subjects must be on stable doses of oral and/or injectable (non-insulin) pharmacological agents (e.g. GLP-1 agonists) for at least 3 months prior to the study screening and after the IA injection till EOS and have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels â‰¤9% at Screening. Subjects on current insulin treatment will be excluded.

After signing informed consent, subjects will be screened and a total of 120 qualified subjects with T2DM will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (1:1). Randomized subjects will be treated with either 32 mg ZILRETTA (60 subjects) or 40 mg TA-IR (60 subjects). Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria may be re-screened once at the discretion of Principal Investigator (PI) after documenting the rationale for any re-screening decision. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria but are found to have insufficient BG data at their Day 1 visit (ie, missing CGM data â‰¥ 30%) may repeat the full 7-day pretreatment phase at the discretion of the PI.

BG Monitoring and Management of T2DM During the Trial After a Screening visit, BG levels in each subject will be measured using a CGM device, for at least 10 days pre-injection (pretreatment period) and for at least 10 days postinjection (post-treatment). The final 10 days of the pretreatment period will be also considered as Baseline for BG control.

Subjects and the assessor responsible for subject's clinical assessments and safety monitoring will be blinded throughout the study to both treatment assignments. Subjects will be blinded to the glucose readings, so as not to influence behaviors that could alter blood glucose outcome measures. However, study endocrinologists will monitor subjects' glucose readings. The study will involve between 6-12 outpatient visits (depending on whether selected for salivary cortisol tesing) and up to 4 phone visits that will include Screening, a Pretreatment visit (Day -14 where the CGM sensor will be placed to initiate study BG data collection), Day 1 (Baseline and treatment), and 2 Posttreatment visits (Days 43, and 85). CGM data will be continuously collected from the treatment visit through Day 15. On Day 15, subjects will remove the CGM sensor. Day 85 will be end-of-study (EOS) visit.

A subset of subjects will will return saliva for cortisol testing at baseline and on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 42, 72, and 90 following treatment.

After IA treatment subjects are should not adjust their diabetes medications and Baseline physical activity should remain unchanged.

Intermediate-acting glucocorticoids (GCs) represent the most commonly prescribed steroid agents. In general, during the course of chronic GC treatment, GCs may require frequent dose adaptations that result in more intensive altered requirements of glucose-lowering therapies. However, since the selected diabetic population will receive a single IA injection, large glucose fluctuations as experienced with chronic GC treatments are not expected. Baseline glucose medication dosage will not change. Subjects' BG control will be monitored in coordination with study endocrinologist.

The analyses of primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted mainly based on CGM device.

Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Evaluation Treatment with GCs represents one of the most frequent causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency. When GCs are used at supraphysiologic doses, HPA axis suppression causes adrenal glands' inability to produce sufficient cortisol response to abrupt treatment cessation (Nicolaider et al, 2018). To avoid HPA axis suppression, it is recommended not to exceed 3 GC IA injections per year with a minimum of 30 days between (Johnston et al, 2015). Recovery of the HPA axis to Baseline normally occurs within 1-4 weeks but can be longer in consideration of the dose and frequency of injections (Habib, 2009). However, after single IA dose of GC injection recovery after 1-2 weeks was observed in most of the patients (Mader et al, 2005). Thus, an initial 90-day salivary cortisol assessment in a subset of this trial population should suffice. An 8 AM salivary cortisol test will be completed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 42, 72, and 90 day following baseline to evaluate the effect of Zilretta and TA-IR on the HPA axis and recovery time.

Intra-Articular Injection On Day 1 (Treatment Day), IA injections will be administered by the assigned blinded, trained injector, who has experience in the administration of IA injections and has been trained on study administration procedures. Injection into the knee joint will be performed with/without ultrasound guidance.

Subjects will be advised to avoid strenuous or prolonged weight-bearing activities for approximately 24 to 48 hours following the injection. If the subject has an immediate reaction (eg, tenderness, increased pain, swelling, effusion, and/or decreased mobility of the index knee), the subject should be treated according to clinical guidelines and physician experience and judgment.

Pain will be assessed by NRS evaluating Worst Daily Knee Pain Intensity and Average Daily Knee Pain, which will be recorded in the pain Diary per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) and reviewed at each study visit. Physical performance will be assessed with OARSI recommended10 physical performance measures (40m walk time and stair ascent time) along with patient-reported physical function (KOOS-PS) and quality of life (KOOS-QoL) at baseline and at intervals following IA injection.

Internal Safety Review Subject safety will be monitored by an endocrinologist. The endocrinologist will review, at a minimum, safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic (PD) data on ongoing basis. All members will be blinded to the treatment.

The study PI and study endocrinologist will review all SAEs on an ongoing basis (ie, as the events are reported). The study PI is responsible for temporarily halting the study if the type, frequency, or seriousness/severity of such events suggests a potential threat to the safety of the study subjects. The safety review team will meet semiweekly or monthly depending upon recruitment rate. Ad hoc meetings may be scheduled as necessary.

The study PI may pause/stop the study if any of the following occurs:

Any deaths, regardless of causality. Non-fatal SAEs in 12 subjects (â‰¥10% of total subject population) where a clear unrelated causality is not readily apparent.

Grade 3 or higher AEs in 12 subjects (â‰¥10% of total subject population) that are clinically significant (Exception: PD parameters or related changes to labs and symptoms will not be considered as AEs) In the event that any of the preceding criteria occurs, enrollment will be paused during the review. If a pausing/stopping rule is met, a decision will be made whether to resume the enrollment.

Case unblinding may be performed for above reviews if necessary and documented accordingly.

Clinical Safety Assessments The index knee assessment will be performed by the designated assessor at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). The index knee will be assessed for injection site reaction, joint effusion, range of motion and presence of Baker's cyst.,. After Day 1 Baseline, new clinically significant findings or findings that worsen from the subject's Baseline knee condition will be recorded as an adverse event (AE).

PD parameters measured during this study such as BG levels (CGM or fingerstick), insulin consumption, HPA axis evaluation parameters, and hyperglycemia symptoms will not be reported as AEs.

Safety evaluations will be based on the assessment of AEs occurring after the initiation of investigational product (IP) on Day 1 through the EOS Visit (Day 85). Results of clinical safety assessments are to be recorded in the subject's medical records and transcribed to the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF), including the AE eCRF for clinically significant findings.

AEs will be coded using CTCAE v.5. Incidences (number and percent) of TEAEs, those events that started after dosing or worsened in severity after dosing, will be presented by treatment group. Incidences of TEAEs will also be presented by maximum severity and relationship to IP. Safety laboratory investigations and vital signs will be summarized descriptively by time point collected along with changes from Baseline assessments.

Statistical Methods Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation \[SD\], median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated by treatment group and time point for continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be presented by treatment group for categorical and ordinal variables.

The primary endpoint of change in percent of time in TAR will be analyzed with linear regression. Both models will have a fixed effect for treatment group along with covariates (eg, the mean of the pretreatment BG values, BMI).

A step-down testing procedure will be employed for primary and key secondary endpoints, with sequential testing proceeded as long as p \< 0.05. Key secondary endpoints and order of testing will be specified in the SAP (Holm, S., 1979. A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure. Scandinavian journal of statistics, pp.65-70).

Study Sample Size A prior Phase II study found a difference of approximately 15 percentage points in TAR for TA-ER vs standard triamcinolone acetonide crystalline suspension (TAcs) (\~35% for TA-ER vs. 50% for TAcs). 120 subjects will provide \>80% power to detect an effect size of 10 percentage points, assuming a standard deviation of 18. The primary outcome will be measured 72 hours after treatment by a sensor automatically uploading the data, thus we expect few dropouts are expected.",24.33333333333333
NCT06477224,"This randomized control trial investigates the effects of scooter board activities on neck control and dysphagia in children with cerebral palsy (CP), focusing on a group of children aged 6 to 10 years diagnosed with spastic CP. The core hypothesis is that scooter board activities, which involve using a flat, wheeled platform where children can propel themselves using their limbs, can improve neck stability and swallowing functions-critical areas that affect posture, movement, and health risks such as malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia.

The study is structured as a controlled experiment with two groups: one receiving the innovative scooter board treatment and the other undergoing traditional physical therapy as a control. The effectiveness of these interventions will be measured using three validated assessment tools:

Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) - This tool classifies the eating and drinking abilities of individuals with CP, focusing on the safety, efficiency, and level of assistance required.

Schedule for Oral Motor Assessment (SOMA) - This assesses oral motor function, evaluating the ability to use lips, tongue, and jaw, which are crucial for eating and communication.

Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) - Used to observe changes in gross motor function, it helps quantify improvements in motor skills that may relate directly to the therapies administered.

The research will take place over six months, following the approval from an advanced research committee and institutional review board. Data will be collected from multiple locations, including Rehab Care, Rich Care, and Royal College Hospital. A total of 22 children will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group.

This trial aims to not only validate the effectiveness of scooter board activities in improving neck control and reducing dysphagia symptoms but also to enhance the quality of life for children with CP by integrating play into therapeutic practices. The potential for significant findings could lead to innovative, engaging therapy options that align with children's natural tendencies towards play, thereby enhancing therapy adherence and effectiveness.",1.6333333333333333

NCT06474234,"Probiotic is live microorganisms that grant health effects to the host if consumed in sufficient amounts. Probiotic bacteria, which beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, may affect the immune response, thus boosting the body system to combat against diseases.

One of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in young children, is diarrhea. In worldwide, it was reported by WHO that 5.2 million of children under five of age die every year due to preventable diseases involving gut health such as diarrhea. Up to date, diarrhea still remains as global health issues, even in developing countries, with 1 million of children deaths reported to be attributed to diarrhea. In Malaysia, reported cases of diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis have been observed to occur throughout the year, with rotavirus-associated diarrhea being the most prevalently identified gastrointestinal disorder.

Probiotics have a been administered to children for the maintenance of gut health and to combat gastrointestinal disorders. In children, probiotics are consumed directly or mixed with a variety of fluids and foods. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophiles), and Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to reduce gastrointestinal-related symptoms in a strain-dependent and dose-dependent manner. In a review involving 15 clinical studies, participants who were on probiotics administration were less likely to have gastrointestinal disorders, indicating the efficacy of probiotics in children. The effect of probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum and Saccharomyces boulardii also showed decreased time of vomiting in the intervention groups as compared with controls during acute rotavirus diarrhoea. The rationale for using probiotics in gut disorders is that they act against enteric pathogens by competing for available nutrients and binding sites, making the gut contents acid, producing a variety of chemicals, increasing specific and non-specific immune responses, and colonization resistance against a wide range of gut pathogens.

Probiotic bacteria, which beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, may affect the immune response, thus boosting the body system to combat against diseases. Probiotics have been studied extensively for their effects in preventing and treating a multitude of conditions, including the treatment of lactose intolerance, traveller's diarrhoea and the prevention and treatment of nosocomial diarrhoea. In acute diarrhoea, a reduction in the frequency of diarrhoeal symptoms has been reported in adults and children treated with probiotics. Among the beneficial microbes, Bifidobacterium is one of the best-known probiotic genus in the world, and it is widely applied in the dairy industry as a probiotic. Evidences from more than 100 scientific publications based on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies and long consumption history support the safety and health benefits of Bifidobacterium strains. The ingestion of yogurt fortified with B. longum reduced harmful bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus and C. perfringens, while at the same time alter the microbiota gut profile of volunteers with a significant increase of beneficial microbes Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Additionally, putrefactive substances in the intestinal environment were also reduced in the presence of the probiotic supplement. Such findings suggest that Bifidobacterium strains are safe and could be used further to evaluate its effect in modulating gut health of children.

Our previous study involving probiotic (Bifidobacterium infantis YLGB-1496) in children with respiratory symptoms (human ethics approval number JEP-2023-074) shows good compliance without any adverse effects. Preliminary clinical assessments have also shown positive feedbacks from parents and guardians.

NCT06477770,"Cesarean section is one of the most performed surgical interventions at the Maternal and Child Hospital. Infection and dehiscence of the surgical site are some of the most common complications in post-cesarean section patients. The Honduran population, like those around the world, is susceptible to surgical site infections due to several risk factors and depends on each patient. Regarding the patients treated at the Maternal and Child Hospital, a surgical site risk of approximately 2-3% is estimated. Therefore, the investigators consider it beneficial to look for alternatives to treating surgical infections that help to reduce hospital time. Granulated sucrose has previously been used as a method for treating surgical wounds, however, no trial has been conducted to determine the benefits of its use.

NCT06480500,"Approximately four thousand Canadians die by suicide every year, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth and young adults (15-34 years). Most people with depression experience thoughts of suicide and many will also plan and/or attempt suicide at some time in their life. There is an urgent need for new scalable treatments that can effectively reduce suicidality in people with depression.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) reduces suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and can be delivered through the internet (i-CBT) making it more accessible and scalable. However, i-CBT has not been shown to rapidly reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviours (suicidality), such as within 24 hours. IV ketamine on the other hand has been shown to rapidly reduce thoughts of suicide, but not suicidal behaviours.

Therefore, combining i-CBT with IV ketamine may be more effective reducing suicidality than i-CBT treatment with a control treatment.

The investigators propose a 13-week, multi-site, study that looks at how combining i-CBT and IV ketamine treatment will affect suicidality in individuals with depression who have recently experienced suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours, but have not responded to previous treatment. All 110 participants will receive a weekly session of i-CBT for 13 weeks, but half will be randomly assigned to also receive six IV ketamine treatments or six IV midazolam treatments (control treatment) over the first initial 30 days.

NCT06472102,"Cardioneuroablation (CNA) is a new method for the treatment of asystolic reflex syncope. Although the procedure is becoming more and more popular, many important issues remain unresolved. One such a problem is the optimal method for identification of presumed sites of ganglionated plexi (GP) which are located in the epicardial fat surrounding myocardium and are the target for CNA. Several methods have been used, including anatomical approach using computed tomography (CT), intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and 3D electro-anatomical mapping (EAM) as well as electrophysiological methods which include high-frequency stimulation and recording of fragmented atrial potentials (FP).

Areas of FAP are sought to represent nerve fibers endings, extending from GPs to myocardium. The technique was first described by in 2004 and spectral analysis with fast Fourier transformation was used to identify these areas. Next, the time-domain quantification of FAP characteristics was performed. It was found that a high number of deflections (at least 4) identified the presumed areas of GPs. Later on, this method was further developed and it has been shown that FAP-guided CNA was associated with shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times. The currently advocated approach is to evaluate FAP for the number of deflections at filter settings of 200-500 Hz or 100-500 Hz. If â‰¥3 deflections are present, these sites are tagged as ablation targets.

However, the role of FAP for the identification of optimal sites for GPs ablation is still debatable. Reproducibility of the results of spectral analysis of GPs areas has not been well established. Also, sensitivity and specificity of both spectral and time-domain analysis of FAP have not been established. The sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91% values were calculated for patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation and not CNA, were based on reflex bradycardia/asystole during RF delivery, mainly at posterior left atrial (LA) wall and not by extra cardiac vagal stimulation (ECVS) after ablation at typical sites for septal GPs. In fact, specificity may be limited because FAP may represent areas of scarred atrial tissue, pulmonary vein (PV) potentials or fragmented electrograms at such areas in the right atrium (RA) as slow pathway region, coronary sinus (CS) os or RA-superior vena cava (SVC) junction. Moreover, the adipose tissue surrounding the heart can infiltrate the atrial myocardium, causing heterogeneous activation resulting in the presence of FAP. In addition, the sensitivity may also be limited since effective RF applications, which cause total vagal denervation confirmed by ECVS, can be sometimes performed at the areas with no FAP. To date, no study examined prospectively and blindly characteristics of FAP in effective and non-effective sites, confirmed by ECVS, in patients undergoing CNA due to reflex asystolic syncope.

Intracardiac echocardiography. This is another tool used for anatomical localisation of presumed GP areas. With ICE, areas of epicardial fat in the so-called pyramidal space, containing paraseptal inferior GP, as well as space between right superior PV (RSPV) and SVC, containing superior paraseptal GP, can be visualised. The correlation between ICE-identified areas of GPs and other tools like CT or FAP has not yet been established.

Computed tomography. Lastly, CT can be used during anatomical approach to identify target sites for CNA. Current techniques enable visualisation of pericardial fat. Also, density of the epicardial fat which may correspond to the density of GPs, can be quantified using CT.

Whether the CT-, ICE- and FAB-based localisation of presumed GP's areas perfectly overlap each over or there is a significant difference in their localisations, is not known.

Aims.

1. To assess the predictive value of FAP for identification of presumed areas of GPs localisation.
2. To examine differences in FAP characteristics between superior and inferior paraseptal GP's areas.
3. To assess the anatomical concordance between FAP-, ICE- and CT-based sites targeted during CNA.
4. To describe the FAP, ICE and CT-based characteristics of the sites where vagal denervation was achieved as assessed by ECVS.

Methods. Patients. The study group consists of consecutive patients undergoing CNA in our institution. Patients are offered CNA if they have severe, recurrent symptoms due to reflex syncope with ECG documented asystole \>3 seconds, especially if associated with injury, or recurrent presyncope with persistent reflex bradycardia. The patients have to have a history of ineffective prior non-pharmacological treatment and positive baseline atropine test (sinus rate acceleration \> 30% and no AV block following 2 mg of intravenous atropine). All patients gave informed written consent to undergo CNA and to participate in the study (Research Grant CMKP #17/2024, Ethics Committee approval # 42/2024).

Cardioneuroablation. The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia with muscle relaxation using a 3.5 mm irrigated tip catheter (Navistar ThermoCool SmartTouch) with contact force module and electroanatomical mapping (EAM) system Carto 3 (Biosense Webster, US). The ablation index is set at 500 except coronary sinus (CS) where the target value is 350. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) (Acuson SC2000, Siemens, Germany, AcuNavâ„¢ Ultrasound Catheter, Biosense Webster, US) is used throughout the whole procedure and serves for guiding ablation, including identification of epicardial fat tissue with presumed GP areas. Thus, the ICE images and EAM are used as ""anatomical"" approach to perform CNA.

The ECVS is performed using two diagnostic catheters positioned in the right and left jugular veins utilizing neurostimulator designed by Dr Pachon (Sao Paulo, Brazil) (pulse amplitude of 1 V/kg body weight up to 70 V, 50 ms width, 50 Hz frequency, delivered over 5 sec). Complete bilateral vagal denervation of both sinus and AV nodes (no sinus arrest, slowing of sinus rate no more than 10% compared with baseline and no AV block with PR interval no longer than at baseline), documented on ECVS, is the end-point of CNA.

Ablation is started in LA at the anterior antrum of the right superior PV (RSPV) where the superior paraseptal GP (SPSGP) is located, followed by ablation of the inferior paraseptal GP (IPSGP) at the floor of LA. Next, these GPs are ablated from the RA. If the intraprocedural endpoints of CNA are not achieved by ablation of paraseptal GPs, additional applications in the LA at the sites of superior and postero-lateral LA GPs are performed, followed by applications in the CS. The procedure is performed using pure anatomical approach, based on ICE and EAM, and the operator is blinded to the CT and FAP results. The amplitude of distal and proximal recordings from the ablation catheter are truncated to zero and CT images, merged with the CARTO system at the beginning of the procedure, are not displayed during CNA.

The ECVS is performed after each RF application to assess whether this specific burn caused no vagal denervation (\<10% change in sinus pause or AVB still present), partial vagal denervation (10-90% shortening in sinus pause or lower degree of AVB still present) or complete vagal denervation (\>90% reduction of sinus pause duration and no AVB). If after achieving complete vagal denervation additional consolidating RF applications are performed, ECVS is not repeated and these sites are not taken in the analysis.

At the end of the procedure, atropine test is performed in order to assess the residual, if present, vagal nerve activity. The value of \< 10% of increase in sinus rate following atropine injection (2 mg iv) is taken as complete vagal denervation. Regardless of the results of this test, further RF applications are not performed and the procedure is completed.

Fragmented electrogram recording and analysis. For the purpose of comparing FAB between superior and inferior septal GP's, FAP are recorded at each site during constructing EAM before starting RF applications. For the purpose of assessing predictive value of FAP characteristics, FAP are recorded before each RF application (as previously described).

Bipolar endocardial potential recordings at each site of RF application are analysed at an ECG speed of 400 mm/s and filter setting 100-500 Hz. Three FAP parameters are measured - number of deflections, maximal amplitude and total FAP duration.

The measurements of the number of deflections are performed according to Aksu et al and Lellouche et al. Number of deflections is assessed as the number of turning points (positive to negative direction or vice versa) in each FAP. The FAP is defined as atrial electrogram with \> 3 deflections, however, other cut-off values for the number of deflections are also tested.

The amplitude of FAP is measured in mV as the difference between the most negative and the most positive deflection. The duration of FAP is measured in milliseconds from the onset of the first deflection to the end of the last deflection.

All atrial electrograms are divided into (1) normal AP with â‰¤ 3 deflections; (2) low-amplitude FAP with amplitude (difference between maximal positive and maximal negative deflection) \< 0.7 mV, and (3) high-amplitude FAP with amplitude â‰¥ 0.7 mV.

The analysis of FAP is performed off-line by an investigator who is blinded to the procedural details, including which GP was ablated and what was the ECVS result after each RF application. In order to overcome possible spontaneous variability of FAP characteristics caused by electrode movements in a beating heart, the mean value of three consecutive FAP recordings is taken as a final parameter.

Intra- and inter-observer variability of FAP measurements will be also assessed.

Computed tomography is performed using the Somatom go.Top (Siemens, Germany) tomograph. After acquisition, the images are sent for further processing and reconstruction to the inHeart platform. Acquisition will be performed according to the protocol used by the inHeart. In brief, as many as possible complementary scans are acquired. In this protocol, the acquisition is focused on the maximum filling volume of the atria. The acquisition window is set on the systolic cardiac phase (200-400ms from R wave). The amount of contrast and parameter settings are refined according to patient age and possible renal failure. During the arterial phase the acquisition mode is prospective / sequential. All the technical details are in the inHeart brochure.

When the CT reconstruction with the epicardial fat is received from the inHeart, it is merged with the map obtained in the EAM system Carto-3. Care is taken to make the most accurate matching, using right and left pulmonary artery, CS and ICE images as the anchor points. Next, areas of presumed areas of GPs identified by ICE are marked on the EAM using the CartoSound module (Biosense Webster, US). The ICE-based and CT-based areas with epicardial fat are compared visually and also using the Carto system software which enables calculation of the area and volume of a given structure. Also, visual correlation between ICE-based RF applications points and localisation of epicardial fat areas imaged by CT will be performed. As stated before, the identification of presumed GPs areas will be based on ICE and EAM whereas CT images will be used after ablation to compare ICE-based and CT-based localisations of epicardial fat and GPs.",19.666666666666668
NCT06482593,"The goal of this clinical trial is to conduct an in vivo study that allows to compare the periapical healing process of 3 different sealing cements through CBCT, as well as implement the evaluation of these lesions through volumetric measurements to provide high-level scientific information and thus have the possibility of being applied in the clinical dental practice, in patients attending UNICOC dental clinics between 2023 and 2024.

NCT06482086,"This research trial aims to determine the efficacy of organoid-guided targeted therapy for patients with locally advanced thyroid cancer. We will also investigate the variables affecting the effectiveness of targeted therapy for locally advanced thyroid cancer that is guided by organoids. Additionally, side effects related to the medication are also studied.

The following are the main questions that the trial seeks to address:

Can patients' tumor sizes be shrunk by taking medications that were found to be sensitive by organoid screening? Can patients' survival outcomes be improved by the medications that organoid screening found as sensitive? What aspects of the medications shown to be responsive by organoid screening are impacting their clinical efficacy? Is it possible for organoid-based drugs screening to guide treatment which lower surgical risk and make cancers that are now incurable into manageable ones? To ascertain the efficacy of the screened sensitive drugs in treating locally advanced thyroid cancer, researchers will measure the tumor size before and after taking the organoid-screened sensitive targeted drugs, assess the risk of radical resection, and document the survival outcomes of enrolled patients.

To further elucidate the parameters impacting the efficacy and prognosis, prognostic analysis based on clinical and pathological data, such as pathological type, gene mutation, age, tumor size, distant metastasis, and involvement of the trachea, esophagus, or major artery, will also be conducted.

The sample size for this study was determined based on the objective response rate (ORR) observed in our preliminary pilot study, which indicated an ORR of 22%. For papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), we aimed to detect a treatment effect with a minimum ORR of 12%, consistent with results from the previous multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (DECISION). For anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we aimed to detect a treatment effect with a minimum ORR of 1%, considered the threshold for clinical efficacy.

To achieve a one-sided 95% confidence interval (Î± = 0.05), the Clopper-Pearson method was used to calculate the confidence interval for a proportion. This method ensured that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval would exceed the minimum ORR (12% for PTC, FTC, and PDTC; 1% for ATC and MTC).

The calculation indicated that a total of 42 samples are needed for PTC, FTC, and PDTC, while 5 samples are required for both MTC and ATC.

Considering a 10% dropout rate and an 80% success rate for organoid drug sensitivity tests, a total of 59 samples are needed for PTC, FTC, and PDTC, while 7 samples are required for both MTC and ATC.",42.63333333333333
NCT06472544,"The prevalence rate of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Blackfeet Nation members is among the highest in North America. With our current NARCH funding, we have found that cultural connectiveness in members of the Blackfeet Nation ameliorated the pro-inflammatory effects associated with high exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACES). This raises the question of whether improving cultural connectedness might be an effective, trauma-informed approach to improve function, outcome, and/or a sense of well-being in individuals with rheumatic diseases such as RA. The plausibility of taking this approach is grounded on the high exposure rates to ACEs in individuals living on and near the Blackfeet Reservation and the strong association between ACEs and systemic inflammation. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that a trauma-informed intervention aimed to improve cultural connectiveness will improve subjective and objective features of RA in individuals living on or near the Blackfeet Nation Reservation. This research project will serve the overall goal of the NARCH grant by: (1) building on past NARCH research to better understand physical and mental health of the Blackfeet Nation; (2) building capacity for health research at BCC-CCM through engagement and training of BCC students, driving scholarly productivity of BCC faculty, and building new inter-institutional collaborations; and (3) generate compelling results to address health concerns for the Blackfeet Nation. We propose 2 aims that can be accomplished over the time frame of this application:

Specific Aim 1: We will test the effects of a 2-week intervention designed to connect individuals with RA more strongly to Blackfeet language, cultures, ceremonies, and land. This pilot intervention of limited size will consist of assessing the clinical symptoms of RA, ACES scores, and biomarkers of inflammation before and immediately after the culturally grounded intervention. This pilot will inform a second, more encompassing intervention in aim 2. Specific Aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that a 2-week intervention to improve cultural connectedness in individuals with RA living on or near the Blackfeet Nation result in objective changes to pro-inflammatory markers, including markers associated with disease activity in RA. We believe developing an intervention which could reduce systemic inflammation could not only ameliorate symptoms of RA but possibly other inflammation-mediated diseases as well.",60.86666666666667
NCT06471738,"Follicular lymphoma (FL)is the most common inert non Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Their natural courses are slow but highly variable. The standard first-line treatment of advanced FL is based on rituximab. Whether combined with chemotherapy or not, it can induce lasting remission, but it is usually incurable. Although the first-line immunochemotherapy regimen has high efficacy, it also has high toxicity. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is related to many side effects, including bone marrow suppression and immunosuppression, gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity, neurotoxicity and the occurrence of secondary tumors. About 20% of FL patients relapse within 2 years after first-line chemotherapy. The overall prognosis of these patients is poor.

NCT06481995,"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a main reason for maternal mortality and morbidity. PPH, defined by the WHO as blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours after delivery, causes about 30% of maternal deaths worldwide. The internationally observed trend towards increased PPH-related morbidity and mortality is disturbing and demands new strategies in the prevention and treatment of PPH.

Although the most frequent causes for severe PPH are believed to be uterine atony or retained placenta, virtually all cases of severe PPH lead to a disorder of the coagulation system which itself aggravates bleeding.

At the moment, most guidelines on coagulation management during PPH and expert opinions focus on the replenishment of coagulation factor I (fibrinogen) although three out of three randomized controlled trials with early or pre-emptive administration of fibrinogen during PPH were negative.

Based on earlier research, it was hypothesized that coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) might play a significant role in women with increased postpartum blood loss, because of its role in the establishment of blood clot stability and fibrinolytic resistance. This hypothesis was tested in a prospective diagnostic study involving 1300 parturient women at the University Hospital Zurich and showed that pre-partum factor XIII activity had a strong association to postpartum blood loss.

Therefore, this nationwide, multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial in major perinatal centers across Switzerland will be conducted. The goal is to determine if postpartum blood loss and PPH-related complications can be reduced by substitution of FXIII at an early stage of PPH.

Irrespective of the answer to the question whether FXIII is effective in the treatment of PPH, this trial will contribute to enhancing the comprehension of coagulopathy in the context of PPH",48.4
NCT06473181,"Cerebral palsy (CP) could be a cluster of disorders that have an effect on the event of movement and posture,inflicting activity limitation, and nonprogressive disturbances that occurred within the developing fetal or child brain.The main therapeutic goals for children with CP are the performance of functional activities and walking.

Children with CP have a limitation with activities due to the existing impairments in independent walking, climbing stairs, running, or walking over uneven surface .Functional limitation of children with CP may have various degrees due to loss of axial control with an imbalance of their movement .Balance has been defined as the elements of postural control that allow a child to safely perform everyday tasks . Poor balance control is one of the most contributing factors for poor gait and reaching movement because the maintenance of stability is critical to all movements . Children with CP have defects in postural mechanisms, including righting and equilibrium reactions, antigravity mechanism, proximal stability, and postural fixation . Diplegia is amongst the most widely recognized clinical subtypes of Cerebral Palsy (CP). It is used when the motor impairment is milder in the upper limbs than the lower limbs. Most children have major weakness in the trunk and hypertonic limbs .Diplegia is characterized by increased muscle tone with difficulty in relaxing. Active movements are slow and stiff with abnormal patterns. Lower limbs are more affected than upper limbs. Head and neck are unaffected but there is weakness and limited rotation of the trunk . Children with CP may experience a range of functional limitations as a result of loss of trunk control and movement imbalance. Balance is defined as the postural control elements which enable a child to safely execute daily tasks.Because maintaining stability is necessary for all movements, low balance control is one of the extreme common causes of unsafe walking or reaching function . So core stability training is preferred to maintain position and movement of body core. Stability training involves the abdomen muscles and pelvic and shoulder muscles, which maintain postural alignment and allow movements of extremities. Postural control is mainly for motion and depends on these muscles for stability and endurance. Components of core stability include strength, endurance, balance,nd the related activity of the back, abdominal, and pelvic muscles . The core muscles act like one block to keep the body stable during static state and with extremity motion . CP children lack the ability to distribute the load, that is, body weight, appropriately during static balance and transfer the body weight adequately from one supporting limb to another during dynamic balance tasks . Children with diplegic CP are characterized by impairment of motor control in the lower extremities more than in the upper extremities.

Statement of the problem This study will be conducted to answer the following research question:Is there any significant effect of core stability exercises on standing , balance and gait in Diplegic cerebral palsy children ? Purpose of the study The purpose of this study is to study the effect of core stability training on standing, balance and gait in spastic diplegic cerebral palsy children.

Significance of the study Spasticity, muscle contraction, bony malformations, loss of selective motor control, and muscle weakness are potential factors that interfere with normal gait patterns in diplegic CP. Recent studies have found that muscle weakness limits motor function in children with CP more than spasticity. Therefore, strengthening weak muscles is es-sential for spasticity management to improve the func-tion of diplegic CP.Balance disorder is a serious problem for children with diplegic CP, and this can make it difficult to achieve and maintain equilibrium. Children with diplegic CP have reduced neuromotor perceptual func-tion, inadequate stance stability in different sensory settings, slow anticipatory response, and inaccurate pre-paratory activation.

The term of ""core stability"" explains the capacity to control the position and movement of the central portion of the body. Core stability training targets the muscles deep within the abdomen that attach to the spine, pelvis and shoulders, that help in the preservation of proper posture and provide the basis for movements of extremities in a coordinated manner. Spinal stability is essential for the production of movement and relies on the core muscles to acquire sufficient strength, power, and endurance .The core has illustrated by researchers as a ""power-house"" for initiating limb movement or as a double-walled cylinder or box in which the abdominals act as the front of the house, the paraspinals serve as the back, the diaphragm serves as the roof, and the musculature of the hip girdle and pelvic floor create the 2 basement of the house.",2.066666666666667

NCT06474078,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) belong to life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions. SJS/TEN is classified by the extent of the detachment over the total body-surface area: SJS (\<10%), SJS-TEN overlap (10%-30%), and TEN (\>30%). TEN has the highest mortality (30-35%); SJS and transitional forms correspond to the same syndrome, but with less extensive skin detachment and a lower mortality (5-15%). Currently, there is still no conclusive effective immunomodulator treatment for SJS/TEN. And, there is still a clinical unmet need for the treatment of SJS/TEN.

According to our past research reports, interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays an important role in SJS/TEN, which is related to disease severity and mortality. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can inhibit the downstream JAK to inhibit the production and transmission of inflammatory cytokines, as a treatment for severe skin drug hypersensitivity reactions. Tofacitinib, a JAK1/3 inhibitor, is an intervention known to effectively treat several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Notably, a recent study identified a potential therapeutic target with JAK-STAT pathway in a patient with recalcitrant and refractory drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Based the current evidence, a targeting therapy to IL-15 by tofacitinib treatment are suggesting likely to be effective in treating SJS/TEN.

This is an ""open label"" study, all patients enrolled in the study will receive the active medication; meaning that there will not be a placebo or control group. The aims of this project are (1) to investigate the effect of tofacitinib treatment for SJS/TEN patients, including healing time, mortality rate, adverse events, beginning of re-epithelialization time, internal organ recovery time, and ocular complications, and (2) to investigate the molecular mechanism of SJS/TEN after tofacitinib treatment through collection of timed samples to include DNA, RNA, PBMCs, blister cells and supernatant and skin tissue.

The primary outcome of the study is the time to complete re-epithelialization as defined by complete absence of erosion on the skin. The secondary outcomes are to determine the time to beginning of epithelization (defined as the time to start re-epithelialization of the erosions on the skin and mucosa), the time to halting of progression of SJS/TEN (considered significant progression if there are any new blistering lesions or any new detached or detachable skin), mortality, length of hospitalization, ocular complications, infections, and adverse events.

NCT06470555,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder affecting adults in the United Kingdom. In patients with AF who continue to experience symptoms despite medications, catheter ablation is an established interventional treatment. Ablation is performed by inserting a number of plastic tubes in the veins in the groin, in order to access the heart.

Despite continued advances in equipment and techniques, groin complications remain the most common complications after AF ablation. The severity of these can range from minor (e.g. bleeding resolvable with manual pressure) to major (bleeding requiring blood transfusion, prolonged hospitalisation, intervention, or rarely resulting in death).

Following ablation, the plastic tubes in the groin are removed before leaving the procedure room. Once removed, the doctor will stop the bleeding in the groin. There are two commons ways in which the doctor can stop the bleeding: 1) conventional treatment with manual compression - the doctor applies pressure with their hands to the groin area to stop the bleeding; 2) suture treatment (also known as a ""stitch"") - the doctor inserts a suture to the groin area and secures this in place with a small plastic device (called a three-way tap). The suture and three-way tap are left in place for a few hours before being removed. Both of these methods are commonly in use. However, there is no high-quality evidence to support whether one way is better than the other.

After stopping the bleeding, patients are generally asked to lay flat for 4 hours to prevent any bleeding. It is not known whether this duration can safely be shortened.

NCT06477510,"Periodontal disease refers to inflammation of the periodontal tissues resulting in clinical attachment loss, alveolar bone loss and periodontal pocket formation. Periodontal disease is amongst one of the most common diseases affecting majority of the population around the world. Patients with periodontal diseases may present with bleeding, redness, swelling or edema in the gingiva, gingival recession, gingival enlargement, loss of the supporting periodontal tissues and tooth mobility. All these conditions affecting the periodontium are detrimental for individual's quality of life and may also disrupt their esthetic appearance. A number of factors are substantial for dental esthetics such as color and shape of the teeth and shape of the dental arch. However, gingival health and appearance is also crucial for an esthetically pleasant smile and patients with periodontal problems may face aesthetic problems. Gingival recessions in the anterior teeth can often be a topic of concern, and this non-aesthetic appearance can be observed within the patient's smile, speech or chewing. Localized or generalized gingival enlargement may also result in both aesthetic and functional problems for affected patients. Additionally, the color of gingiva as well excess gingival display can pose esthetic concerns.

Until recently, clinical research has been focused mainly on the course of periodontal disease, its diagnosis, development of appropriate treatments, as well as its clinical response. In this context, a real full impact study, which refers to perceptions and satisfaction of patients in relation to the treatment, has historically not been an object of interest in most investigations. However, in recent years, patients' own assessments of dentofacial aesthetics have become an increasingly popular topic, gradually emphasizing on esthetic conditions as perceived by patients.

Therefore, the present study has been designed to evaluate the change in patients' perception of aesthetics post non-surgical periodontal treatment using the PAPS scale, the Numeric rating scale and global rating scale with the aim to explore the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment in stage I/II/III periodontitis and assess the psychometric properties of PAPS in Indian population, assess the ability of Periodontal aesthetic perception scale to detect difference in patient's perception of aesthetics after non-surgical periodontal therapy and correlate self-reported perception of aesthetics with clinical periodontal parameters (CAL,BOP, PPD, gingival phenotype, gingival recession, interdental papillary height, gingival pigmentation and gingival display).

The present longitudinal study will be conducted in the Department of Periodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak.Translation, adaptation and validation of PAPS (Periodontal aesthetic perception scale) will be done in Indian population by using the questionnaire on patients reporting to department of Periodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak. Following this, systemically healthy patients with Stage I/II/III Periodontitis will be recruited on basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each participant, demographic data like age, sex, level of education, marital status, socio-economic status and area of residence (urban/rural) will be recorded. Assessment of self-perception aesthetics using PAPS score, NRS and Global Transition Scale will be done at baseline. For all patients, periodontal charting will be done from second premolar to second premolar in both maxillary and mandibular arch.

Oral hygiene instructions and mechanical supragingival scaling followed by subgingival instrumentation as needed on case-to-case basis with both ultrasonic scalers as well as hand instruments. No adjunctive chemical oral hygiene aids or antibiotics will be used.

Re- evaluation of patient's perception of esthetics will be done at 4 weeks. Both patients' perception of esthetics and clinical periodontal parameters (clinical attachment level (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP), plaque index (PI), gingival phenotype, gingival recession, interdental papillary height, gingival pigmentation and gingival display will be re-evaluated at 3 month follow up appointment post non surgical periodontal treatment with ultrasonic scaler or hand instruments as required.",15.233333333333333

NCT06476496,"Long-COVID has negatively impacted millions of individuals' quality of life, daily functioning, and ability to work, and has placed enormous demands on the healthcare system. Pain-related symptoms are reported by a large subset of patients with long COVID, and yet pain is still not consistently addressed in workups or treatment plans. Thus, we have chosen to study acupuncture for improving pain, quality of life, and function in individuals experiencing long COVID-related pain. Acupuncture has been shown to be successful in treating various types of chronic pain and should lend itself to similar results with pain related to long COVID. Furthermore, acupuncture focuses on treating the whole patient, which makes it uniquely well-suited for a complex condition affecting multiple body systems, like long COVID.

We propose an initial study to determine the feasibility of successfully conducting a subsequent fully-powered pragmatic randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture for persistent pain problems experienced by persons with long COVID. Acupuncture is a physical treatment that aims to correct imbalances in the body (including inflammation and pain) within a Chinese Medicine paradigm.

Our specific aims are to:

1. Assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing acupuncture with usual care alone for reducing pain in patients with long COVID;
2. Evaluate the overall patient experience with participation in the feasibility trial and solicit suggestions about how the study procedures, documents, and treatment protocols could be improved to facilitate participation and better meet participants' needs; and
3. Revise study procedures, protocols, and instruments to prepare for a fully-powered pragmatic randomized trial.

Participants randomized to acupuncture will receive a total of 8 weekly individual treatments lasting one hour each. Participants will lie supine on a treatment table while the acupuncturist inserts needles in selected body points. Bilateral needling of the pre-specified acupuncture points will be performed according to TCM principles and will include efforts to obtain De Qi.

This study has the potential to help patients with long COVID improve function and quality of life, and to provide clinicians with more tools to effectively respond to their patients' needs.

NCT06482697,"Background: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is one of the most common benign gynecological diseases among middle-aged and elderly women, which severely affects the quality of life of patients. Colpocleisis for the treatment of POP has a high success rate and low incidence of complications. The classic colpocleisis is divided into total colpocleisis and partial colpocleisis (LeFort). However, there are no long-term follow-up large-scale randomized trials to compare the clinical efficacy, complications between the two surgical methods. This study aims to compare the incidence of surgical complications, objective surgical success rate, subjective satisfaction rate, pelvic floor symptom improvement rate, and regret rate in patients with pelvic organ prolapse treated by total colpocleisis and LeFort.

Methods: This trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-blinded non-inferiority trial, comparing the application of hysterectomy with total colpocleisis and LeFort in symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse patients with no need for vaginal sexual life, and aged â‰¥70 years. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of surgical complications, including perioperative and postoperative complications within 3 months, as well as the incidence of severe complications. Secondary outcomes include the objective surgical success rate, subjective satisfaction rate, pelvic floor symptom improvement rate, and regret rate at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-surgery.

NCT06470581,"Thoracic sympathetic ganglion block is a percutaneous procedure that paralyzes the action of sympathetic nerves transiently by injecting a local anesthetic around the ganglion. It is performed to diagnose and treat sympathetically maintained pain in phantom limb pain or complex reginal pain syndrome patient. The temperature of the affected arm is often lower than that of the opposite side. As a result of the procedure, the patient may experience sympathetic pain relief, such as coldness, stinging, numbness of the upper extremity. If the procedure does not last long, repetitive block or chemical neurolysis or radiofrequency thermocoagulation for the sympathetic ganglion is performed.

However, even though in rare cases, chemical neurolysis is known to cause permanent plexus injury radiofrequency thermocoagulation is known to be less successful than chemical neurolysis because it is difficult to identify and stimulate the exact location of the ganglion. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a benefit to the patients if there is a procedure with long-lasting and avoiding injury.

Recently, it has been reported that botulinum toxin (BTX) has been successfully used for the treatment of pain disorders. BTX plays a role with blocking the secretion of acetylcholine from the cholinergic nerve endings. Therefore, the use of BTX is expected to prolong the effect of neural blockade because pre-ganglia sympathetic nerves are cholinergic. It is also known that the action of BTX is not permanent and BTX does not exhibit cytotoxicity or neurotoxicity. Therefore, Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) is recommended for the treatment of migraine, myofascial pain syndrome, and neuropathic pain accompanied by allodynia.

NCT06473987,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 2.87 million people annually in the US and is a leading cause of long-term disability. TBI impairs both cognitive and sensorimotor functions, with debilitating consequences on ambulation (gait \& balance), which persist during the chronic stages of recovery. Individuals with TBI-induced gait \& balance dysfunction are at a higher risk of falls leading to another TBI. Gait \& balance control is a complex interplay between various cognitive and motor processes, and disruption of any of these processes can severely affect gait \& balance and result in falls. Research examining TBI-related changes in cognitive demands associated with gait \& balance control has shown increased cognitive demand to perform gait \& balance tasks in individuals with TBI, with increases in cognitive demand for more complex tasks. This strong link between cognitive (attention, processing speed \& executive function) and sensorimotor functions is the basis for the proposed project. The investigators aim to strengthen this inseparable link using a novel cognitive-motor intervention.

The investigators propose a training regimen, cognitive integrated sensorimotor training (CMT), which increases the cognitive-motor effort to perform the tasks. CMT uses virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) to employ the cognitive system to perform the motor task in order to train the inseparable cognitive and motor components that are critically important for gait \& balance function. Here the cognitive task is ""incorporated"" into the motor task, as the cognitive task is a relevant prerequisite for successfully completing the sensorimotor task. The investigators hypothesize that CMT will maximize gait \& balance function and reduce falls in adults with TBI.

The study will evaluate the differences between three intervention groups (n=45 each): a) personalized cognitive integrated sensorimotor VR/AR training (CMT), b) traditional dual-task training (CTRL), and c) standard of care (SOC) on gait, balance, community ambulation, and cognitive functions, as well as underlying biomechanical and neurophysiological mechanisms to understand the changes due to CMT.",48.66666666666666

However, the majority of studies using interventions in neurodiverse individuals have taken a deficit-based approach (i.e. to fix what is deficient in a person). This approach has triggered increasing criticism and dissatisfaction from the disability community. Further, focusing on deficits will not result in identification, awareness, or expression of strengths, important skills needed for self-advocacy and transition to adulthood. KF-STRIDE takes a strength-based approach, using principles of positive psychology to help N-TAY identify and express their unique character strengths to future employers. Over the course of a recently funded pilot study, the team has evaluated the efficacy of KF-STRIDE in those on the autism spectrum.

NCT06475170,"The incidence of proximal gastric cancer has increased significantly in recent years. This may be due to weight gain, alcohol consumption, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and precancerous lesions.

NCT06471426,"Myofascial pain is a major health problem that results in a decrease in life quality and functioning, and it imposes a burden on healthcare systems. Muscles and joints of the cervical spine contain numerous sensory receptors that are important for the integration of head and neck movements with temporomandibular joint and eye movements. In humans, jaw and neck movements are integrated, possessing a high degree of spatiotemporal consistency. This is necessary to maintain natural jaw function. Because of neural and myofascial connections, dysfunction in one region can cause dysfunction and pain in a neighboring region. Jaw and cervical spine dysfunction have been linked previously. Orofacial pain and temporomandibular joint dysfunction are both associated with increased stiffness of the masticatory muscles and neck disability and muscle tenderness. Also, abnormal craniocervical posture that manifests as forward head malposition with hyperextension of the upper cervical is commonly associated with dysfunction of the CCMU. Considering head and neck postures can influence muscle stiffness and activity, it is plausible that positional changes in the neck, such as poor posture, are part of a larger somatic dysfunction sequela that reflects biomechanical alterations of the CCMU that can eventually lead to chronic pain and dysfunction in eye and jaw motion. In addition to myofascial dysfunction, the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in chronic pain has been documented and is related to dysfunctional pain that continues in the absence of noxious stimuli. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between neck pain and temporomandibular dysfunction and pain, impaired eye movements, visual disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction.

Manual therapies have been shown to restore myofascial and autonomic balance. OMT directed at the cervical region can restore balance to both the CCMU and the autonomic nervous system, which can improve function and decrease pain. Treatment of the deep neck muscles, including the suboccipital muscles, is effective at improving neck pain, disability and range of motion. Also, this can manifest as an improvement in jaw and eye motion, and a restoration of balance within the autonomic nervous system. Further research is needed to better understand the role of CCMU dysfunction in chronic pain conditions of the head and neck and to provide a mechanistic understanding of OMT in the treatment of CCMU dysfunction.

The primary objective is to measure the effects of OMT on tissues of the CCMU in individuals with neck pain and headaches. Specifically, investigators will measure the following as part of this objective:

* Stiffness changes in the masseter, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and semispinalis capitis and cervicis.
* Eye tracking changes measured by a smooth pursuit neck torsion test (SPNT).
* Changes in jaw morphometrics during motion using a 9 -marker setup and capturing motion using VICON.
* Changes in autonomic function (heartrate variability, skin conductance, pupillary response) using a battery of tests including divided attention test, Valsalva maneuver, cold pressor test, and deep breathing.
* Pain pressure threshold measured by algometry.

A secondary objective is to demonstrate a relationship between the clinical presentation of CCMU dysfunction and self-reported complaints of stress, anxiety, pain, and disability and how OMT affects these self-reported measures. To achieve this secondary objective, the investigators will use the following:

* Self-reported visual disturbances measured by survey.
* Depression, Anxiety, and Stress measured by Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21).
* Average neck pain, headaches, and temporomandibular joint pain duration, intensity and frequency measured by survey.
* Functional ability measured by the neck disability index (NDI).
* Headaches measured by the Headache impact test (HIT-6).

This research aims to answer possible mechanisms of OMT intervention in CCMU dysfunction that presents clinically as neck pain, headache, dizziness, and visual disturbances. In addition, the investigators aim to demonstrate a relationship between self-reported measures of pain and disability and dysfunction while demonstrating improvements in these measures because of OMT treatment.",12.166666666666666

NCT06479811,"Background:

* Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) have been shown to be over-expressed in a number of human tumors, including gastrointestinal (GI) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas (PPGL), small cell lung cancers (SCLC), kidney cancers (KC), and some head and neck (H\&N) cancers.
* Targeted radioligand therapy (TRT) is a class of cancer therapeutic agents formed by attaching a radioactive isotope to a ligand that can target specific surface receptors such as SSTR on a tumor cell membrane. Efficacy is typically determined by the radiation dose deposited onto a tumor, which is determined by the radioactive isotope being used as well as the binding characteristics of the ligand-receptor/transporter pair.
* Alpha emitters such as 212Pb emit alpha particles that are more damaging to tumor cells than beta emitters such as 177Lu. Therefore, TRT agents using alpha emitters are considered to be more potent than beta-emitting TRTs.
* VMT-Alpha-NET is a peptide that binds to SSTR, which when attached to 212Pb becomes an alpha particle-emitting TRT that can be used to treat tumors that have SSTR surface expression.
* \[203Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET is the chemically identical imaging surrogate for \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET and has the same mechanism of action via binding to SSTR2. The nuclide 203Pb contained in \[203Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET emits gamma radiation suitable for single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging. These images can be used to assess drug product biodistribution throughout the body.

Objective:

-To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET (dose escalation cohort) and assess the safety of \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET at the MTD (dose expansions cohorts).

Eligibility:

* Age \>= 18 years.
* Histopathologically confirmed GI NET, PPGL, SCLC, KC, or H\&N (nasopharyngeal carcinoma \[NPC\], olfactory neuroblastoma \[ONB\], sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma \[SNEC\]) cancers that are metastatic or inoperable.
* No prior systemic radioligand therapy.
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status \<= 1.

Design:

* This is an open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase I study evaluating the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET in GI NET, PPGL, SCLC, KC, or H\&N cancers.
* First, participants will be accrued in Dose Escalation Part with 4 dose levels to estimate MTD of \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET. Once MTD is estimated, the following participants with GI NET, PPGL, SCLC, KC, or H\&N cancers will be accrued in separate cohorts and treated at MTD of \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET.
* \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET will be given IV every 8 weeks for a total of 4 administrations.
* A subset of participants (Dosimetry Arm 1) will have \[203Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET administration followed by whole-body gamma scans combined with dosimetry SPECT/ Computed Tomography (CT) scans and collection of blood and urine samples prior to the first and the second doses of \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET (Cycles 1-2).
* All participants will undergo serial whole-body dose rate measurements after \[203Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET and/or \[212Pb\]VMT-Alpha-NET administration.
* Participants will have timed clinical laboratory evaluations, imaging studies, and research blood, and urine samples while on the study therapy for safety and efficacy evaluations.
* Following completion of treatment, participants will be seen at the NIH Clinical Center approximately 30 days later, every 12 weeks for 3 years after that for safety and efficacy assessments. Beyond 3 years, participants will be contacted annually through any NIH-approved platform to assess for overall survival and health status.",54.73333333333333

NCT06477198,"Spine surgery in thoracolumbar region is one of the most common surgeries performed for the treatment of leg and back pain. Pain management is especially important for these patients since chronic pain often occurs after surgery. Severe pain may occur at postoperative period in patients following lumbar disc herniation (LDH) operation. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to hospitalization such as infection and thromboembolism may be reduced.

Opioids are one of the most preferred drugs among the analgesic agents. Parenteral opioids are generally performed for patients after surgery. However opioids have undesirable adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, itching, sedation and respiratory depression (opioid-related adverse events).

Various methods may be performed to reduce the use of systemic opioids and for effective pain treatment. US-guided interfascial plane blocks have been used increasily due to the advantages of ultrasound in anesthesia practice. Ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a fascial plane block where local anesthetic is injected adjacent to the quadratus lumborum muscle to anesthetize the thoracolumbar nerves.

The ultrasound (US) guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is a novel interfacial plan block defined by Forero et al. at 2016 The ESPB contains a local anesthetic injection into the deep fascia of erector spinae. This area is away from the pleural and neurological structures and thus minimizes the risk of complications due to injury. Visualization of sonoanatomy with US is easy, and the spread of local anesthetic agents can be easily seen under the erector spinae muscle. Thus, analgesia occurs in several dermatomes with cephalad-caudad way. Cadaveric studies have shown that the injection spreads to the ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. ESPB provides thoracic analgesia at the T5 level, abdominal analgesia at the T7-9 level, and lumbar analgesia at T10-12, L3 level. In the literature, it has been reported that ESPB provides effective analgesia after lumbar spine surgery.

This study aims to compare US-guided posterior QLB block and ESPB for postoperative analgesia management after lumbar disc herniation-laminectomy surgery. The primary aim is to compare postoperative pain scores (NRS) the secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative opioid consumption, motor block, and adverse effects related to opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).",0.0

NCT06480370,"Background: During supratentorial brain surgery there is a risk of iatrogenic injury resulting in post-operative motor deficits. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) can help surgeons avoid this outcome, while also expanding evidence of its prognostic and preventive benefit (1, 2). However, there are still pending issues, such as standardization of optimal methodologies for data acquisition and interpretation as well as technical improvement.

There are two main IONM strategies: mapping to localize nervous structures, and monitoring to provide real-time assessment of functional integrity (3). With respect to monitoring, muscle motor evoked potentials (MEPs) enable motor system assessment. They can be elicited by pulse train transcranial electric stimulation (TES) through scalp electrodes placed at standard 10-20 system sites (C1, C2, C3, C4, Cz-1cm, Cz+6cm), or at neuronavigation-guided scalp sites. The stimulation circuit consists of the user-selected anode and cathode sites chosen from the scalp electrodes (4). The stimulation parameters are user-selected pulse duration, interstimulus interval (ISI), number of pulses, and single train stimulation vs. double-train or multi-train facilitation. MEP threshold is the stimulation intensity required to elicit a certain number of MEPs with a predefined amplitude. The recording montage consists of user-selected recording electrode orientation and target muscles. Practitioner preferences for these technical aspects vary widely (5), and can influence monitoring efficacy.

During surgery, significant MEP deterioration from an earlier baseline indicates a warning based on various criteria such as amplitude reduction or threshold elevation (2). Warnings trigger rescue manoeuvres to recover MEPs. With reversible MEP deterioration (recovery to values above the warning level), a post-operative motor deficit might be prevented. Continuous real-time monitoring facilitates this favourable result by providing early warnings, and is therefore important. With irreversible MEP deterioration there is an increased risk of a motor deficit (1), and discontinuous intermittent monitoring may fail to help prevent this adverse outcome.

A major concern regarding TES MEPs is that the stimuli often produce movement of the surgical field, which entails the risk of the patient being harmed by surgical manoeuvres if they are not paused during the measurements (4). This can delay the surgical procedure and/or preclude real-time monitoring. Thus, there is a need to establish optimal TES MEP methodology that minimizes objectively assessed movement.

Objective: The hypothesis of this project is that MEP stimulation and recording paradigms can be optimized to minimize movement of the surgical field during supratentorial brain surgery. Consequently, the overall aim is to identify the most effective stimulation and recording techniques to maximize TES MEP performance by minimizing movement. The specific objectives are to determine:

1. The best stimulation circuit to elicit MEPs with the lowest possible movement;
2. The best stimulation parameters to elicit MEPs with the lowest possible movement;
3. The best recording montages to obtain MEPs with the lowest possible stimulation threshold.

Methods: General methods: Adult patients undergoing routine brain surgery with IONM and giving informed consent will be eligible. Muscle MEP recordings will be performed from limbs ipsilateral to the operation side. Patients with preoperative ipsilateral motor impairment will be excluded. Movement and MEP threshold will be the primary endpoints. Movement will be assessed through one accelerometer on the forehead (with quantification through kinetic energy). For comparison (secondary endpoint), another accelerometer on the ipsilateral shoulder to the recording site will be used, as well as the subjective evaluation by the surgeon on an ordinal scale, through visualization of the surgical field. Additionally, we propose to quantify the magnitude of motion using post-processing of digital images from the surgical microscope.

Comparative analyses of movement and MEP thresholds will be performed by successively varying one of the variables and keeping the others at Inselspital standard. Videos of the surgical field will be recorded with the microscope for all the proposed experimental setups, to recover the images for the quantification of the movement.

The study will be divided into four different parts, each of them with different steps (outlined below). Consequently, each patient participates in a specific part and stepThis subdivision is necessary due to time constraints in the operating room, as it would not be feasible to perform all the different combinations on every patient.

Patients who have already been included in the study and require a redo surgery will also be eligible for inclusion in a different part or step of the study.

Threshold current will be defined as the minimum current to elicit MEP responses with an amplitude higher than 20 ÂµV in at least 5 consecutive trials. The procedure will be to increase current until MEPs appear, then reduce current until they disappear, and then finely adjust current to the minimum for a consistent response.

The Fugl Meyer scale, the Motor Evoked Potential test, and the Modified Ashworth scale were the instruments utilized. They came to the conclusion that low frequency rTMS plus MRP was more effective than MRP alone at improving spasticity and motor function in stroke patients with hemiparesis.

A study was done in 2023 on the effect of motor relearning program with obstacle walking on dynamic gait performance and functional mobility in sub-acute stroke subjects in India.Group B underwent a 30-minute obstacle walking program in addition to Group A's motor relearning program. Group comparison of the DGI and MAS pre- and post-test results revealed statistically significant differences in both groups. In order to improve dynamic gait performance and functional mobility in sub-acute stroke patients, they found that while both interventions were effective on their own, the motor relearning program in conjunction with obstacle walking was superior to the motor relearning program used alone.

A study was done on effects of the home-based exercise program with an augmented reality system on balance in patients with stroke; a randomized controlled trial in 2022. 68 stroke patients were enrolled in this study under the supervision of a blind observer. The written and visual HEP was administered to patients in the smart rehabilitation group. They came to the conclusion that the smart-rehabilitation group had a greater change in balance than the control group.

A study was done in 2019 on the impact of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and motor relearning on improving functional mobility in individuals with sub-acute stroke. The goal of the research was to determine whether proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and motor relearning could improve functional mobility in patients with sub-acute strokes. There were thirty subjects, aged 45-55, who were in stages 3 and 4 of Brunnstrom recovery after having a stroke. They concluded that compared to subjects treated with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation alone, those treated with a motor relearning program and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation showed improvements in functional mobility.

In another study which was done in 2018 on the topic aerobic with resistance training or aerobic training alone post stroke: A secondary analysis from a RCT. They investigated the effects of AT+RT versus AT on psychological outcomes in chronic stroke with motor impairments. They concluded AT+RT versus AT yielded similar significant improvement.

Many studies have determined the effects of motor relearning program and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation on functional mobility and balance but according to the researcher's knowledge there is no evidence of effects of motor relearning program on postural stability. Moreover, the effects of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular fitness and upper limb function have strong evidence but little research has been done on the effects of aerobic exercise on lower limb in stroke patients. The literature gap between studies on effects of aerobic exercise and motor relearning program is wide. The aim of this study is to bridge this gap by providing evidence-based recommendations and optimizing exercise strategies tailored to the unique needs of the sub-acute stroke patients.",6.0
NCT06482983,"In laparoscopic interventions, the Trendelenburg position should be applied and artificial pneumoperitoneum should be created by CO2 insufflation. Trendelenburg position is widely used in laparoscopic surgery and open abdominal surgery. The head-down position classically refers to a 45Ëš inclination of the head. However, in gynecologic operations, this inclination is usually much more than 45 degrees and the position of the head is close to the floor. Feet are in lithotomy position. The blood flow is towards the head during surgery and the venous head is slowed down in the neck region due to the position. Most case reports and case series of venous complications, usually venous thromboembolism (VTE), associated with laparoscopic surgery have been reported in patients in reverse Trendelenburg with associated pneumoperitoneum.Increasing intra-abdominal pressure with pneumoperitoneum and the deep Trendelenburg position will move the diaphragm caudally, decreasing lung functional capacity (FRC). The major respiratory complications associated with the Trendelenburg position during laparoscopic surgery are mainly due to a combination of both the position and the associated pneumoperitoneum and the resulting pressure on the diaphragm. As this upward pressure must be balanced by increased airway pressures to adequately ventilate the patient, the patient is at risk of pneumothorax, atelectasis and mediastinal emphysema. These adverse respiratory effects are more pronounced and longer lasting in patients with comorbid lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Anesthesiologists are acutely aware of this risk and therefore adjust various ventilation parameters to continue to limit the pressure at the alveolar level to improve oxygenation. Different modes of mechanical ventilation and different PEEP can cause an increase in intrathoracic pressure, as well as a decrease in venous return under vena cava inferior pressure due to increased intra-abdominal pressure. The Trendelenburg position increases preload and alters cardiac output. Since perioperative atelectasis may develop and oxygenation may be affected, prophylactic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is recommended intraoperatively. Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum have been reported to increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and alter cerebral blood flow (CBF) or volume (CBV). Changes in ICP, CBF or CBV affect cerebral perfusion pressure. Therefore, gynecologic laparoscopic surgery may affect cerebral oxygenation by altering cerebral hemodynamics.

Since standard monitoring may not be sufficient to determine the conditions in which cerebral oxygenation is affected, monitoring techniques such as cerebral oximetry, which measures rSO2, have recently been used. Thanks to NIRS, cerebral oxygenation can be detected early before tissue hypoxia occurs. In the literature, there are few studies using NIRS in gynecologic laparoscopy operations with Trendelenburg and pneumoperitoneum.PCV-VG is the newest ventilation mode in anesthesia equipment. PCV-VG is an innovative ventilation mode that uses a decelerating flow and constant pressure. Ventilator parameters are automatically changed with each patient breath to deliver the target tidal volume without increasing airway pressures. It delivers the preset tidal volume with the lowest possible pressure. PCV-VG therefore has the advantages of both VCV and PCV to maintain target minute ventilation while producing a low incidence of barotrauma. The PCV-VG mode delivers breaths with the efficiency and clinical benefits of PCV, but still compensates for pressure changes with consistent tidal volumes. Because of its benefits, clinical applications during surgery have been reported. The VCV mode used in standard anesthesia practice can guarantee target minute ventilation but a constant flow rate can lead to higher peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), increasing the incidence of barotrauma and causing uneven distribution of pulmonary gases. To avoid high inspiratory pressures, a lower tidal volume (VT) and faster RR can be used, but lower VT is known to predispose the dependent lung to atelectasis and worsen arterial oxygenation. Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode has arrived as an alternative mode in laparoscopic surgeries. PCV delivers tidal volume at a preset pressure and inspiratory durationThe flow is slow, unlike VCV. This flow pattern has a high initial rise followed by a decline and helps to achieve tidal volume at lower peak inspiratory pressures and oxygenation is also better due to the initial high flow rates. However, with changing lung compliance the delivered tidal volume changes and there is always a risk of hypoventilation or hyperventilation. PCV minute volume, tidal volume should be closely monitored. With pressure control modes, barotrauma risk protection and effective oxygenation can be provided against airway pressure increase that may occur due to deep trendelenburg and intraabdominal pressure increase. The risk of atelectasis is reduced by close monitoring of lung compliance changes.",13.166666666666666

NCT06481696,"On the basis of the last estimates, the global lifetime prevalence of infertility is 17.5%, which means that approximately one in six people have experienced infertility at some stage in their lives.

Despite an improvement in conventional diagnostic investigations, still today, around 25% of the causes of couple infertility remain unexplained.

In fact, several crucial moments of the human reproductive process cannot be studied and, therefore, specific reproductive alterations remain undiagnosed. Just thinking of the process of ovarian folliculogenesis, oocyte development, embryonic implantation, all ones real ""biological mysteries"".

Among these different biological aspects, it is known that the oocyte quality is the main predictor of clinical pregnancy after IVF/ICSI. Indeed, oocyte maturation process influences the embryo development and, consequently, the embryo viability. Although the mechanisms that determine a good quality oocyte are not known, nevertheless energy-dependent processes are supposed to play a major role in oocyte development. These processes are mediated by mitochondria, whose concentration in oocytes is the highest among the other cells of human body. The oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation is strictly connected with the growth of granulosa cells (GCs). These cells surround the oocyte and establish a functional bidirectional cross-talk with the oocyte itself through gap junctions and paracrine factors. During folliculogenesis, GCs increase the consumption of glucose and metabolize glucose into pyruvate which passes to the oocyte. All this determines an increase in the energy supply to the oocyte itself, demonstrated by the increase in ATP production, which allows the latter cell to prepare for fertilization and the first stages of embryonic development which, as known, is totally oocyte dependent .

Resveratrol seems to be able to fit into this area of cellular functioning. It is a natural polyphenol, widespread in foods, plants, drinks and it seems to induce GCs proliferation through an anti-apoptotic effect in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Furthermore, in GCs, resveratrol reduces the oxidative stress, increases the mitochondria biogenesis and the intracellular ATP levels, determining a high energy availability which favours the oocyte growth. Resveratrol seems to reduce in rat granulosa cells the expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), implicated in angiogenesis and vascular permeability, potentially showing a protective effect on the risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), a life-threatening condition associated with ovarian stimulation, whose VEGF is the main mediator.

A recent clinical randomized trial showed that a pre-treatment of 3 months with resveratrol, in women affected by couple infertility and undergoing ICSI, was associated with a higher number of retrieved and mature oocytes, a higher fertilization rate, a higher number of blastocysts per patient and a higher number of surplus cryopreserved embryos per patient, even if no significant effect was observed in clinical pregnancies and live birth rates.

Based on this last evidence and given the potential beneficial effects of resveratrol in folliculogenesis and in oocyte development, the investigators designed a randomized, controlled, double-blind, single-center trial, whose objective will be the comparison of biological and clinical outcomes of resveratrol supplement in women undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles for unexplained infertility.

To the knowledge of the investigators, no study has been published on the potential effect of resveratrol on IVF/ICSI outcomes considering couples with this infertility diagnosis, which may be the natural target of this integrative treatment because the process of folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation cannot be routinely investigated. An alteration of these biological mechanisms could be the unrecognized cause of part of the unexplained infertility and treatment with resveratrol could result in significant clinical improvement for the patients enrolled in the study.

In more details, the main objective of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center trial will be the evaluation of the possible effect of resveratrol in determining a better follicle development in patients with unexplained infertility undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for IVF/ICSI.

Infertile female patients with normal ovarian reserve will be treated according to clinical practice and the difference between expected (through AFC) and retrieved oocytes will be assessed in relation to use of resveratrol.

DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:

Couples affected by unexplained infertility will be enrolled. The definition of unexplained infertility is the following: infertility in couples with apparently normal ovarian function, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and pelvis, age â‰¤ 40 years and with adequate coital frequency; and apparently normal testicular function, genito-urinary anatomy and a normal ejaculate.

All patients will be randomized for no treatment (placebo Group - only folic acid) and for treatment of resveratrol (Study group) with a 1:1 ratio. The randomization list, generated by a software, will be managed by a nurse not directly involved in the study and will give the patients the drugs for all duration of treatment. Neither the physicians/embryologists neither the patients will be aware of the content of the boxes of drugs (folic acid or resveratrol) (Double blind design).

The duration of treatment will be at least 65 days before the starting of stimulation (from the stage of pre-antral follicles) and until the day of oocyte pick up.

All the AFC determinations will be performed by the same two physicians from 2nd to 6th day of the cycle, in one of the last three months before the starting of stimulation. All the follicles ranging from 2 to 10 mm will be recorded (distinguishing between the follicles ranging from 2 to 5 mm and those ranging from 6 to 10 mm).

COS will be carried out by daily injections of rFSH (Gonal F; Merck Serono, Italy) and will be started on the 2nd/3rd day of the cycle and continued until the day of induction of oocyte maturation. The pituitary suppression will be obtained by the administration of the GnRH antagonist ganirelix (0.25 mg per day, Fyremadel, Ferring S.p.A.), which will be started from the 6th day of the ovarian stimulation until the day of induction of oocyte maturation.

Follicular development will be monitored after 5 days of treatment and thereafter at least every 2 days. Monitoring will consist of: a) transvaginal ultrasound scan to evaluate the number and maximum diameter of ovarian follicles and the endometrial thickness; b) the dosage of 17Î²-oestradiol, LH and progesterone only on the day of induction of oocyte maturation. The transvaginal ultrasound for monitoring will be performed by the same two physicians.

Highly purified urinary hCG (Gonasi HP, IBSA Farmaceutici, Italy) 10.000 IU, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, will be used to induce final oocyte maturation when two or more follicles of â‰¥16 mm in diameter will be observed and will be administered 35.5-36 h before planned oocyte retrieval. In case of OHSS risk, the final oocyte maturation will be obtained by using a GnRH agonist (Triptorelin, Decapeptyl 0.1 mg, Ipsen S.p.A., Italy) 0.3 mg subcutaneously, and the oocyte retrieval will be planned with the same modalities described above; in this case, all the embryos obtained will be cryopreserved.

No difference in the number of oocytes retrieved was shown comparing these two different modalities of triggering the final oocyte maturation (Haahr et al., 2017).

The trigger of oocyte maturation will not be achieved in case of inability to reach at least 2 follicles â‰¥16 mm.

The oocyte pick ups will be performed by the two physicians with the highest level of expertise.

Fresh transfer of embryos will be performed on the second, third or fifth day after retrieving the oocytes.

In case of OHSS risk and/or in case of progesterone rise on the day of hCG administration (â‰¥1.5 ng/ml), all the embryos will be cryopreserved. The couples with all frozen embryos will be considered for the analysis of the endpoints.

SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:

To pursuit the aims of the present study protocol, a priori sample size calculation was conducted to determine the minimal number of participants required. Data available in the literature indicate in average a difference of 1.5 in the no. of pre-ovulatory follicles (â‰¥16mm) between the group treated with resveratrol and the control group, with an average increase of 15% in favour of the study group. Thus, considering a conservative difference of 10%, which is equivalent to a large effect size of d=0.80, a power (1- Î²) of 95%, an alpha of 0.05, a two-tails t-test, and a ratio of 1:1 between the two groups, a total of 90 subjects (45 for each group) would be needed to verify a significant difference in primary outcome between the two groups.",19.266666666666666

Group A will be administered oral methotrexate 10mg/week after a test dose while group B will be administered tablet azathioprine at a dose of 0.3mg/kg daily after. Both group of patients will be advised regarding strict sun protection measures (sunblock, hats, sunglasses etc.). The baseline investigations for both groups will include complete blood picture (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and urine analysis while thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) levels will be assessed specifically for group B patients.

NCT06480422,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common life threatening disease affecting population. It is a preventable and treatable lung disease. People with COPD must work harder to breathe, which can lead to shortness of breath and/or feeling tired. Autogenic drainage (AD) works by adapting your breathing and maximizing airflow within the airways to improve ventilation and clear sputum. Segmental breathing, also referred to as localized expansion breathing, is the exercise used to improve ventilation and oxygenation. This research of randomized controlled trial will check the combined effects of segmental breathing technique and autogenic drainage technique in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by taking sample of 40 patients through non probability convenient sampling and randomly allocating them into two groups A and B out of which A will receive both autogenic drainage and segmental breathing technique, B will receive autogenic drainage only for upto the duration of 3 days per week(20-45 min) for upto 4 weeks.Pre and post training outcomes will be measured through pulse oximeter,spirometer and BCSS.The data will be analyzed through SPSS 25.",6.066666666666666
NCT06483035,"Phantom limb pain is pain experienced to arise from and reside in the amputated limb, hence the name, phantom limb pain. PLP is experienced by about 50-80 % after acquired limb loss. The pain can be excruciating, and chronic phantom limb pain (PLP) can have a truly devastating effect on a persons' life, affecting both physical function and quality of life. Unfortunately, phantom limb pain has proven difficult to treat both by pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. Several treatment options have been suggested, but without showing strong research evidence for effect on PLP.

Over time, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of PLP, but the most cited reasons for the existence or development of phantom limb pain are theories connected to neuroplasticity, cortical reorganization and maladaptive changes due to loss of sensory input and motor control (e. g. Pons. Science, 1991). Several studies have observed that phantom limb pain is closely associated with neuroplastic changes in the somatosensory and motor cortex of the brain. Although these are maladaptive changes, the fact that the adult brain retains a neuroplastic capacity also opens a therapeutic widow of opportunity, i. e. it makes it possible to envision non-invasive therapies that exploits the principles of brain plasticity in the treatment of phantom limb pain by designing treatments that conceivably may reverse maladaptive changes and possibly reduce PLP.

Relating to this, functional activity of the affected limb, including the use of a prosthesis, has been seen to have a positive effect on PLP, and this effect is believed to be partly explained by an effect of motor activity of the remaining stump on brain cortical activity and possibly cortical reorganization (Mosely and Floor Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair, 2012). This is also the rationale behind classical interventions such as ""mirror therapy"", first proposed by Ramachandran (Nature, 1995).

The present study will investigate the effect of a novel method for treatment of phantom limb pain that extends the concept of mirror therapy. This new method entails viewing a virtual limb (phantom limb) on a large screen, that ""substitute"" the missing limb. In short, the treatment starts with making a videorecording of the intact limb of the patient performing different predetermined movements. This recording is then digitally ""flipped"" and two ""intact"" limbs are then displayed on a large screen in front of the patient. The amputated limb is hidden below the screen. The patient is then asked to execute a set of movements with the (hidden) amputated limb, and at the same time the person will observe the phantom limb on the screen perform the exact same (prerecorded) movements. This treatment protocol is called Intensive Visual Therapy (IVS) and extends the concept of mirror therapy, where only the intact and healthy limb is performing movements and there is no motor planning or motor execution of the amputated limb.

In this project, the effect of the IVS method on reduction of phantom limb pain will be compared to ""Usual Care"" (UC), which will be considered the standard treatment. Persons with either unilateral upper or lower limb amputation will be included in this study. In conjunction with use of these two therapeutic approaches, advanced, neuroimaging tools (functional near-infrared spectroscopy; fNIRS) will be implemented with the purpose of investigating the neurological responses to IVS treatment. As opposed to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the fNIRS system allows the measurement of brain activity in a more ""naturalistic"" setting, like when the participants ""execute"" movements with the phantom limb in the IVS system.

Participants in this study will be randomized to either IVS or UC treatment. Measurement of PLP and other outcome measures will be performed at baseline, after eight weeks of IVS or UC and at 2 months follow-up. Persons in the UC group shall continue with their standard treatment for this entire period (8+8 weeks). Persons in the IVS group will receive two treatment sessions per week for eight weeks and then no treatment in the follow-up period (8 weeks). The UC group will have the opportunity to receive IVS treatment after terminating their follow-up period.",24.33333333333333

NCT06472466,"The present study aims:

1. To measure eating- and sleep-related behaviours and psychological functioning over time (6-9 months) in a large sample of secondary school students aged 14 to 17 years old and identify individuals at risk or exhibiting clinical symptoms in order to signpost them to self-help written materials and clinical support;
2. To establish whether increased emotional reactivity to disease-related stimuli (sleep- or eating-related) in a virtual reality environment discriminates between individuals at risk or with clinical levels of eating and/or insomnia and healthy peers;
3. To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to test a virtual reality self-help exposure-based intervention for eating or sleep difficulties, targeting increased emotional reactivity to disease-related stimuli.

A minimum of 854 adolescents will be recruited and assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-to-9 months follow-up.

A mobile application has been specifically designed for this study, incorporating gamified elements to enhance engagement and adherence. The app can be downloaded for free on participants' mobile devices and will play a crucial role throughout the study, serving multiple purposes. It will be first used as an assessment tool: participants will complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Moreover, they will receive notifications to collect Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data. Finally, it will provide access to self-help written materials on sleep and eating habits and disorders that participants will be able to read and download from the beginning of the study.

The sample size was estimated based on the recommendations for sample size calculation in prevalence studies. The calculation was performed using the Scalex sample size calculator and was based on four parameters: level of confidence, which was set at 95%; level of precision of the estimated prevalence, which was set at 3%, the recommended threshold for large scale studies likely to gain attention from policy makers; estimated prevalence of the disorder, which was established at 20% based on prevalence of sleep and eating problems among Italian adolescents; anticipated loss, which was set at 20% based on the loss of data at six months in previous studies.

Assessment phase.

Students whose parents will have given informed consent to participate in the study will complete the baseline assessment through the App and provide information on:

* gender, age, family composition, and history of mental health disorders;
* sleep behaviours and insomnia symptoms: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); Sleep Health Dimensions Questionnaire
* eating behaviours and symptoms: Screening Tool for Eating Disorders (SCOFF); Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0)
* history of weight-based victimization
* depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21)
* strengths and difficulties regarding emotional functioning: Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-IS)
* emotional, behavioural and interpersonal difficulties and prosociality: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)
* social media usage: Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS).

They will also undergo a 4-day EMA to assess sleep and eating behaviours, sleepiness, eating disorder symptoms, and emotional states multiple times/day.

At three- and six-to-nine months follow-up, participants will complete a subset of measures completed at baseline:

* Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)
* Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0)
* Screening Tool for Eating Disorders (SCOFF)
* Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21)
* 4-day Ecological Momentary Assessment; EMAs

Self-help written materials have been developed by the research team for the purposes of the present study. They consist of a short booklet about sleep and eating behaviours and disorders, providing strategies to cope with them. Contents will be available to participants from the beginning of the study. They will be able to both read and download them directly from the application on their mobile devices.

Individuals identified as at high-risk for, or with insomnia (ISI, total score min=0; max=28, cut-off= 8 for high-risk individuals, cut-off=15 for clinical levels of insomnia)/eating disorder symptoms (SCOFF, total score min=1; max=5, cut-off 3) at baseline and at 3 months will be invited to take part in a 15-min virtual reality exposure session to measure emotional reactivity to eating and/or sleep-related stimuli. Individuals at high-risk for/with insomnia will be exposed to a virtual bedroom, while individuals at high-risk for/with eating disorders will be exposed to a virtual kitchen. A control group (with no symptoms of eating disorders or insomnia) will also be recruited and exposed to both the virtual bedroom and virtual kitchen in randomized order.

Intervention phase. Participants in the high-risk/clinical group (approximately N=100) will be randomly allocated to an intervention or a control condition. Those in the intervention condition will be asked to use the virtual reality scenario for a week, at home, with the aim of reducing emotional reactivity associated with sleep or eating-related stimuli. Those in the control condition will only have received access to the self-help written materials. Visual analogue scales will be presented to evaluate anxiety levels before and after the exposure. Feasibility and acceptability of the virtual reality environments will be assessed through visual analogue scales and a qualitative interview.

NCT06483074,"Diabetes is the leading cause of end stage kidney disease in developed countries. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home-based and cost-effective modality of kidney placement therapy. Maintenance of residual kidney function (RKF) is one of the most crucial objectives to improve outcomes of PD patients. Observational studies showed that residual urine volume or residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but not peritoneal creatinine clearance, independently predicted patient survival. This benefit is likely attributed to better volume control, improved nutritional status, preserved endocrine function and enhanced clearance of uremic toxins in the presence of RKF. However, current therapeutic strategies to preserve RKF were most limited to the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and biocompatible PD solutions.

Hong Kong adopted the 'PD-first' policy since 1985, and has the highest proportion of PD patients in the world. Inadequate dialysis, which is directly related to the loss of RKF, is the second most common reason for a permanent transfer to hemodialysis among PD patients. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria and delay progression of chronic kidney disease even in patients with advanced stages of kidney disease. It is postulated that the renoprotective effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors may be extended to dialysis population since a considerable proportion of patients still have urine output. SGLT2 inhibitors may potentially attenuate GFR decline in PD patients because heavy proteinuria independently predicted decline in residual GFR and onset of anuria. Moreover, preclinical studies suggested that empagliflozin reduced inflammation and oxidative stress by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines, inducing expression of anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages, and antagonizing the effect of advanced glycation products. This beneficial effect may be particularly relevant to PD patients, where subclinical inflammation is common and inversely correlated with RKF.

Despite the potential promising effect of SGLT2-inhibitors in RKF in PD patients, dialysis patients were excluded in previous randomized controlled trials. In the present study, the investigators hypothesize that oral empagliflozin in addition to RAAS inhibitor, compared to RAAS inhibitor alone, better preserves RKF in patients newly started on PD. After a run-in period of 6 to 8 weeks where the dose of RAAS inhibitors are uptitrated to maximally tolerated dose, 48 incident PD patients will be randomized to empagliflozin or control (no empagliflozin) for a total of 6 months. This study aims to explore the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, adequately powered randomized controlled trial that investigates the effect of empagliflozin on RKF in incident PD patients.",25.33333333333333

NCT06477848,"Adolescents are at increasing risk of overdose death. Since 2020, the overdose crisis has expanded most rapidly among younger populations, largely because of the recent reality that any illicit substance (e.g., counterfeit pharmaceuticals, methamphetamines) used by adolescents has the potential to contain lethal amounts of fentanyl. Preventing overdose deaths, therefore, necessitates identifying and treating youth - not only with opioid use disorder (OUD) - but any substance use disorder (SUD).

The investigators seek to ensure a robust workforce is available and equipped to deliver interventions to youth with SUD. The investigators will do so by implementing a multifaceted intervention to change the cultural and procedural norms of pediatric primary care settings regarding adolescent SUD treatment. The investigators will take advantage of a large-scale roll out of integrated behavioral health (IBH) to improve assessment and treatment of adolescents with substance use and SUDs. Intervention components for this adolescent SUD IBH program consist of task-shifting within primary care settings to facilitate delivery of brief SUD intervention, case management, provider-to-provider (P2P) consultation regarding adolescent OUD pharmacology, telehealth SUD/OUD service delivery (when indicated) and stigma-reduction interventions.

The investigators argue that pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) could play a critical role in clinical management of adolescent SUD/OUD, since most youth attend annual well-child visits and PCPs already regularly engage around management of mental health disorders. However, current primary care norms present barriers to expanding the availability of effective SUD care for youth. First, most adolescent PCPs fail to sufficiently screen or inquire about SUD treatment needs, especially emergent needs associated with disorders like OUD. Relatedly, PCPs have notoriously limited time with patients, rendering appropriate SUD assessment and delivery of even brief interventions challenging to implement and sustain within primary care. While effective treatments and specialists are theoretically available for youth with SUD/OUD, stark workforce gaps in community-based behavioral healthcare prevent PCPs from being able to make meaningful referrals to services. For instance, of the Indiana buprenorphine prescribers surveyed by our team, less than 9% were willing to accept patients under age 18. Without viable referral options, PCPs face a conundrum about how best to care for their patients as they often lack formal SUD-related training, leaving them feeling unqualified to diagnose, discuss, and treat SUD/OUD in youth independently. Lastly, PCPs and their staff commonly hold high levels of stigmatizing attitudes toward people who use illicit substances and people treated for SUD, particularly OUD; PCP stigma is associated with less willingness to provide needed care. Empirically supported team-based solutions are needed to shift primary care norms, address stigma, and expand the workforce to meet the needs of adolescents with SUD/OUD.

The research team will capitalize on the infrastructure of three statewide initiatives to improve behavioral healthcare for adolescents: 1) IU Health's Pediatric Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) Project, which is in the process of embedding behavioral healthcare providers/procedures in primary care practices across Indiana; 2) the Indiana Adolescent Addiction Access Program (AAA), a statewide provider to provider (P2P) consultation program focused on adolescent SUD/OUD; and 3) ENCOMPASS, an established hybrid telehealth outpatient dual diagnosis treatment program for adolescents with more severe SUD, including OUD. The primary purpose of the proposed intervention is to formally combine, build on, and increase uptake of the resources available through these initiatives to shift primary care practice toward delivering effective adolescent SUD care.

R61 Specific Aims: Convene a Parent and Youth Advisory Board, Primary Care Provider Advisory Board, and Integrated Care Expert Panel (Aim 1) to inform the development and refinement of the proposed primary care-based SUD interventions. The investigators will apply a person-centered research design approach with the expert panel to refine our screening to treatment approach (Aim 2), coupled with stigma reduction activities, within pediatric primary care.

R33 Specific Aims: Assess the impact of SUD IBH on PCP behaviors around adolescent SUD/OUD intervention. The investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial to compare the effects of SUD IBH on PCP willingness to engage in adolescent SUD treatment. The investigators will evaluate implementation outcomes (views toward MOUD, stigma attitudes, IBH team dynamics; Aim 3) and effectiveness/reach outcomes (delivery of integrated primary care-based OUD/SUD services, the use of MOUD for adolescents, number of P2P consultation calls to AAA, and increased treatment engagement; Aim 4a), along with an exploratory test of local overdose rates for youth (Aim 4b), in order to examine local effects of the new intervention.

Here, the research team of clinician-scientists with expertise in etiology and treatment of adolescent SUDs, implementation science, and stigma reduction will study novel efforts to improve workforce capacity and willingness to deliver SUD services for youth. The research team is ideally situated in Indiana, where investigators can leverage the upcoming roll out of funded statewide behavioral health initiatives to rigorously evaluate how to best provide timely, evidence-based treatment for youth with SUD/OUD.

NCT06480032,"The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effectiveness of low-load blood flow restriction training (BFR-RT) with traditional resistance training exercises (T-RT) in individuals who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. The anterior cruciate ligament is a major knee ligament that provides stability to the knee joint. ACL injuries are common, and surgical reconstruction is often necessary to restore knee stability and function.

The study will be conducted at Rehman Medical Institute over approximately one and a half years. The sample size will consist of 32 participants who meet the inclusion criteria, including having undergone unilateral ACLR surgery within the past 8 weeks and being free of any neurological impairments or significant cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic conditions.

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the BFR-RT group using a random sampling technique. Randomization will be conducted by an independent member of the research team using opaque envelopes containing coded group assignments to ensure unbiased allocation.

The intervention will involve 8 weeks of biweekly unilateral leg press training on the affected limb, totaling 16 training sessions. Participants in both groups will also receive the standard rehabilitation program provided by the hospital. In the BFR-RT group, blood flow restriction will be achieved using an occlusion band placed on the most proximal portion of the affected limb. The physical therapist will ensure the band is not too tight, allowing one finger to pass through the band.

Data will be collected at three time points: post-surgery (week 0-1), mid-training (week 4-5), and post-training (week 9). Outcomes measured include skeletal muscle hypertrophy, strength (assessed using the 10RM scaled maximal isotonic strength), range of motion (ROM) of the knee joint, pain (assessed using a pain scale), and effusion (measured by knee joint circumference).

NCT06476977,"Trigger finger (stenosing tenosynovitis) is one of the most common pathologies assessed by hand surgeons in clinic. Trigger finger involves inflammation or edema of the flexor tendon causing friction of the tendon at the site of the A1 annular pulley located at the base of the affected finger in the palm. Trigger finger is typically managed non-surgically in a clinic setting with percutaneous corticosteroid injection (CSI) which can be successful in alleviating symptoms. Patients with trigger finger who do not respond to CSI, have incomplete relief, and/or who have recurrent symptoms may then receive surgical management with release of the A1 pulley.

CSIs for trigger fingers are among the most common procedures performed by hand surgeons and are often administered multiple times in a single clinic day. CSIs are frequently mixed 50:50 with 1% lidocaine to provide post-injection analgesia for patients as well as symptomatic relief of the trigger finger if acutely inflamed. These injections are commonly administered from a palmar approach into the A1 pulley of the affected digit. Numerous technical variations of palmar trigger finger injections have been described involving either subcutaneous injection superficial to the flexor tendon sheath or intrasynovial (transthecal) injection into the flexor tendon sheath.

Unfortunately, given the rich sensory innervation of the palmar skin, palmar injections are associated with significant pain as the needle pierces the skin. An alternative technique is to provide digital anesthesia from a dorsal webspace approach, injecting the local anesthetic into the flexor tendon synovial sheath. This intrasynovial or transthecal technique has the benefit of a dorsal approach where the skin is less sensitive resulting in less pain (6). This technique has been described previously but is not familiar to many hand surgeons and is not routinely used in North America.

Anecdotally, patients report significantly decreased pain with the dorsal intrasynovial injection technique for trigger finger injections, but pain scores have not been quantitatively evaluated or compared to the pain scores of traditional palmar trigger finger injections. Furthermore, it is not known what distribution of digital sensory blockade is achieved with this intrasynovial technique, particularly on the dorsal surface of the digit which is discontinuous with the flexor tendon sheath and innervated by the sensory branch of the radial nerve.

Accordingly, it is hypothesized that injecting corticosteroids into the synovial sheath of the flexor tendon will result in less pain over 24 hours if performed through the dorsal webspace versus the palmar side of the affected digit.",20.33333333333333
NCT06472934,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common heart valve problem in older adults, affecting about 5% of people over 65. It leads to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart failure, which can increase the risk of serious health issues and death.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a well-established treatment for severe AS, especially for patients who are at high risk for traditional open-heart surgery. TAVR is becoming more common and is now being used in younger and lower-risk patients due to its favorable outcomes.

Many people with severe AS also have other heart conditions, and beta-blockers (B-blockers) are commonly used to manage these issues. B-blockers help treat heart failure, irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. About 34% to 51% of AS patients use B-blockers, but these medications can also cause side effects like slow heart rate and low blood pressure.

The need for a permanent pacemaker is the most common complication after TAVR, occuring in 9% to 26% of patients. This is because TAVR can affect the heart's electrical system. B-blockers might increase the risk of needing a pacemaker because they can further slow down the heart's electrical signals.

To reduce this risk, doctors sometimes stop B-blockers around the time of TAVR. However, this practice lacks support from clinical trials or guidelines, and stopping B-blockers can increase the risk of fast heartbeats and chest pain.

This aim of the clinical trial is to study the impact of B-blocker administration among patients undergoing TAVR. The trial will assess the safety of B-blocker discontinuation (primary endpoint) and by determining the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR (secondary endpoint).

NCT06478953,"Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Molecular pathogen detection techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may help optimize antimicrobial therapy. Its utility for diagnosing respiratory viral infections such as influenza is well established, and was an essential diagnostic tool during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, its use remains limited for bacterial pathogens. The rationale to use PCR based bacterial detection to facilitate antibiotic stewardship is threefold. First, it may shorten the time to pathogen detection. Second, it has improved sensitivity over conventional culture techniques, particularly for pathogens that are difficult to culture. Third, it can detect resistant genes to inform antimicrobial sensitivity. Taken together, utilization of bacterial PCR may shorten time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy and minimize injudicious use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in patients who do not have infection from MDRO.

The BioFireÂ® FilmArrayÂ® Pneumonia Panel (FA Pneumonia Panel) is a PCR based in vitro assay which rapidly identifies 8 viral and 18 bacterial common pathogens in tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. Clinical studies showed that FA Pneumonia Panel on BAL specimens have sensitivity of 75 to 100% and specificity of \>91% for the pathogens tested. Retrospective analysis suggests utilizing FA Pneumonia Panel may facilitate discontinuation or de-escalation of antimicrobials in 48% of patients with an average reduction of 6 antibiotic days. However, currently there are no randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of FA Pneumonia Panel on improving antimicrobial stewardship.

Addition of FA Pneumonia Panel to standard care should shorten time to pathogen and resistance detection, enhance sensitivity over conventional microbiological cultures and shorten time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy by reducing over-narrow and over-broad coverage. Robust clinical trials are now needed to test these hypotheses. We propose to conduct a pilot, randomized, controlled open-label trial designed to determine the feasibility, safety, and potential impact of rapid respiratory pathogen detection by FA Pneumonia Panel on antibiotic therapy in 40 mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with suspected pneumonia.

Various commonly observed hyperpigmentation disorders include melasma, post inflammatory hyperpigmentation, ephelides, lentigines and many more. The histopathology of hyperpigmentation can vary with the various pigmentation disorders. Increased melanin content in both the epidermis and dermis and mild perivascular lymph histiocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry analysis suggests enlarged melanocytes with prominent dendrites, a larger number of dermal melanophages and their melanin deposition. The potential targets for the depigmenting and hyperpigmentation control agents include various cell receptor antagonists, inhibitors of melanocyte stimulation, tyrosinase enzyme inhibitors, inhibitors of melanosome transfer, and degraders of formed melanin in keratinocytes.

Non-ablative skin resurfacing procedures are also effective for improving the appearance of photodamaged and hyperpigmented skin and are becoming increasingly popular because of their minimal downtime and increased safety.

The project's main goal is to examine feasibility, acceptability, research implementation procedures, and preliminary effectiveness of ICI using a mixed-methods approach. The investigators will utilize the extensive catchment area of Nationwide Children's Hospital Behavioral Health (NCH-BH) to complete this work. NCH-BH has a Youth Crisis Stabilization Unit (YCSU) in which ICI can be implemented and compared with outcomes from a traditional adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit (Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Unit \[APIU\]).

In Year 1, the investigators will further develop and refine an intervention implementation guide, including a formalized treatment manual, training and supervision protocols, and data collection processes. They will then pilot test implementation of ICI with 20 adolescents divided across the study age range of 12-17 years, 20 parents, and 10 providers.

NCT06474403,"Introduction:

Parastomal herniation presents as a common complication following stomal surgeries, creating significant morbidity and adversely impacting the quality of life for patients. Traditional open surgical techniques, including Sugabecker's operation, offer variable success rates and potential complications. This study proposes an adaptation utilizing a laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) approach, tailored to enhance the original Sugabecker method while aiming to reduce the perioperative morbidity and recurrence rates associated with parastomal hernia repairs.

Objective:

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the laparoscopic TEP parastomal hernia repair as a modification of the Sugabecker's operation and to assess its outcomes in terms of feasibility, safety, and hernia recurrence rate.

Brief Protocol Description:

Eligible candidates who have developed parastomal hernias following stoma creation and consented to the study will undergo laparoscopic TEP repair. The procedure involves an initial unilateral transrectal incision followed by the creation of an preperitoneal or retro-rectus space where a mesh is positioned to reinforce the abdominal wall and the stoma. Also it will has was formed oblique hernia canal. The operative and postoperative outcomes of these patients will be studied in comparison with control group treated with the traditional Sugabecker's operation.

Scientific Hypothesis:

The hypothesis underpinning this research is that a laparoscopic TEP approach to parastomal hernia repair, modifying Sugabecker's procedure, can provide more favorable outcomes, for example: less intraoperative trauma, fewer bowel injuries due to adhesiolysis, and fewer intestinal perforations. Specifically, it is expected that this minimally invasive method will result in a significant reduction in postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery, decreased morbidity, and lower hernia recurrence rates in comparison with the traditional Sugabecker's or Paul's operations.

Expected Results:

This study anticipates that the laparoscopic TEP repair will demonstrate:

1. A safe and reproducible procedure adaptable to different hernia sizes and locations around stomas.
2. Reduced immediate intra - and postoperative complications, including infections and hematoma formation.
3. Quicker patient mobilization and discharge times when compared with the open approach.
4. A statistically significant reduction in parastomal hernia recurrence over a long-term follow-up when matched against controls who have undergone traditional Sugabecker's repair.
5. High patient satisfaction scores and improved quality of life indicators due to the minimally invasive nature of the repair.

In conclusion, through a detailed analysis of perioperative outcomes, long-term follow-up, and comparative studies with traditional methods, this research aims to establish the laparoscopic TEP approach as a superior modification to parastomal hernia repair, upholding the tenets of enhanced recovery and patient-centered care.",35.5

All participants will be informed beforehand about the characteristics, objectives, and methodology of the present study and must consent by signing the informed consent form, which complies with the regulatory legislation under the Organic Law on Data Protection and guarantee of digital rights 3/2018, of December 5, and Law 41/2002, of November 14, which regulates the patient's autonomy and rights and obligations in terms of information and clinical documentation. (Organic Law 3/2018) recognizes a series of rights for citizens, such as the right of access, rectification, cancellation, and opposition to their personal data, the right to limit the treatment of incorrect data, request a copy, or transfer the data provided for the study to a third party (portability), to the extent that they are applicable.

Sample Size A sample size is estimated for the comparison of two independent proportions at a 5% significance level, an 80% statistical power, and a two-tailed test. Since no published study has evaluated exactly the angulation in both sitting and standing positions under the same conditions, reference values are not precisely known. However, it is estimated that the main outcome variable, peak acceleration, will behave similarly. There is a threshold for this variable at 8 g, such that a peak above this is a risk factor for developing lower limb pathology. In our study, it is expected that only 5% of patients in group A will have a peak above 8 g, while 30% of patients in group B will have a peak above 8 g. Considering these factors and anticipating a 15% possible dropout rate, a minimum sample size of 37 patients per group is needed to achieve the main objective, totaling 74 patients.

Analyzed Variables and Data Collection Procedures Patient data recording will begin on the first consultation day after conducting the relevant screening and fulfilling the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. All data will be collected in a data collection notebook, with each patient assigned an identification code to safeguard compliance with the Organic Law on Data Protection and guarantee of digital rights 3/2018, of December 5, and Law 41/2002, of November 14, which regulates the patient's autonomy and rights and obligations in terms of information and clinical documentation.

Duration of treatment: 12 weeks.

Treatment B: A plantar orthosis made of 4.5 mm polypropylene with BIO, and the MLA taken from the patient replicates the geometry and slope of the MLA in the standing position (loaded). Duration: 12 weeks.

Patient Visit Planning VISIT 1: Inclusion in the study. VISIT 2: Treatment delivery. Acceleration data will be recorded using an Xsens DOR accelerometry system (Xsens, Enschede, Netherlands: total mass: 10.9 g; dimensions 36x30x11 mm, range Â± 16 g), consisting of 3 triaxial accelerometers. Two accelerometers will be placed on the anteromedial surface of the distal end of both tibias, 3 cm superior to the medial malleolus where the first uniform/flat surface is present, with the vertical axis of the accelerometer parallel to the tibial vertical axis; the third accelerometer will be placed on the forehead with the tibial vertical axis; and the third accelerometer will be placed on the forehead with the accelerometer's vertical axis perpendicular to the ground. All accelerometers will be placed by a single researcher (ASR). Patients will wear sports clothing, shorts, and neutral Reebok Classics sneakers. Before starting the test, the patient will walk freely around the room for 5 minutes to get used to the shoes and/or orthosis. Then, the patient will be instructed to walk at a ""comfortable and safe"" speed along a straight 12 m corridor, performing a total of 10 series. Accelerometry data will be recorded during the central 8 meters, with 2 meters at the start and 2 meters at the end designated as acceleration and deceleration zones, respectively, to avoid their effects. The speed of each series will be recorded using a photo-cell system (Chronojump Boscosystem), but it will not be controlled to avoid altering the natural gait pattern. The average speed of all series for each participant will be calculated, and those not within Â±5% of each participant's average speed will be discarded to minimize the effect of gait speed on acceleration impacts.

After this second visit, orthoses A and B will be distributed randomly, dividing the sample into two equal halves, so that patients will use the assigned orthosis daily for 12 weeks.

VISIT 3: 12 weeks after starting the treatment.",4.466666666666667
NCT06482255,"Introduction Background: The shoulder is one of the most mobile yet unstable joints in the human body, making it prone to injuries like tendinopathies, which are among the most disabling injuries in the upper limb. Rotator cuff injuries are particularly prevalent.

Rotator Cuff: Comprises the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor muscles, which provide stability, strength, and movement to the shoulder joint.

Treatment Options: There are conventional (non-surgical) and surgical treatments for rotator cuff injuries. Conventional treatments are often preferred due to fewer complications and lower costs.

Study Objective The study aims to assess the effectiveness of VR in comparison with traditional manual therapy and therapeutic exercise for treating rotator cuff injuries. The goal is to see if integrating VR can enhance patient outcomes.

Methodology Participants: 108 individuals will be recruited and divided into two groups. Group 1: Will receive a combination of VR, manual therapy, and therapeutic exercise.

Group 2: Will receive only manual therapy and therapeutic exercise. Duration: The treatment will last for 10 weeks.

Measurements: The study will measure various outcomes, including:

Quality of Life: Assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. Perceived Pain and Shoulder Disability: Measured with the SPADI questionnaire. Strength: Evaluated using dynamometry. Pain Intensity: Assessed with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Active Shoulder Mobility: Measured using an inclinometer. Assessment Points: Measurements will be taken before treatment, at the midpoint (5 weeks), and at the end of the treatment (10 weeks).

Data Collection and Analysis Data on pain, disability, strength, and range of motion will be collected at three intervals: pre-treatment, 5 weeks, and 10 weeks.

Quality of life will be assessed at the beginning and end of the treatment. Statistical Analysis: Using SPSS version 29.0, descriptive and inferential statistics will be conducted to analyze the data. An ANOVA will be used to study the treatment effects, considering group and time as factors.

Limitations Population Characteristics: The specific demographic characteristics of the study population might limit the generalizability of the results.

Lack of 3D Kinetic Evaluation: The absence of a three-dimensional kinetic evaluation protocol for scapular dyskinesia is noted as a limitation.

Cost of VR Technology: The expense associated with VR technology is highlighted as a limitation since it is still a growing and costly field.

Conclusion The study seeks to provide evidence on whether VR can be an effective tool alongside traditional therapies for rotator cuff injuries, potentially offering new avenues for rehabilitation practices.

NCT06479499,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) poses a significant public health burden, with rising mortality rates and increased disability-adjusted life years. Common symptoms include dyspnea, chronic cough, and chest tightness, often exacerbated by factors like cigarette smoke and air pollution. Functional capacity becomes a notable concern, marked by exercise intolerance and muscle deconditioning due to COPD's characteristic airflow limitation. Anxiety, linked to breathlessness and the chronic nature of COPD, further complicates the interplay, restricting functional capacity and social involvement. Holistic management, including pulmonary rehabilitation, recognizes these challenges. This study aims to compare the effects of Pilates, with its emphasis on proper breathing and muscle activation, and aerobic exercises, known for improving cardiovascular fitness, on dyspnea, anxiety, and functional capacity in COPD patients.

Participants in a research study will be informed and provide voluntary consent before undergoing an 8-week intervention involving Pilates or aerobic exercise, alongside conventional treatments.

NCT06470568,"The aging population in Chile and worldwide is increasing, with older people expected to represent 32.1% of the population by 2050. This demographic shift brings age-related pathologies such as dementia, a leading cause of disability and dependence among older individuals globally. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) precedes dementia and presents a critical therapeutic window for halting or slowing its progression. While resistance exercise training appears promising for this at-risk population, few studies have evaluated its effects on cognitive function and muscle strength in individuals with MCI.

Hypothesis: Twelve weeks of progressive resistance exercise training will significantly improve cognitive function, skeletal muscle mass, and strength in people over 60 years of age with MCI compared to the usual therapy in the control group.

Goal: The main objective of this study is to compare the effect of progressive resistance exercise training with usual therapy (control group) on cognitive function, skeletal muscle mass, and strength in individuals over 60 years of age with mild cognitive impairment.

Methodology: In this randomized controlled trial, 60 participants (both men and women) aged 60 years or older will be recruited. Participants will be identified with MCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ). They will be randomly assigned to two equal groups: a control group (receiving usual therapy) and an intervention group (receiving usual therapy plus resistance training). Participants in the control group will receive usual care for 12 weeks, including one medical review and one educational talk. Participants in the intervention group will maintain their usual therapy and will participate in supervised full-body resistance training with a kinesiologist, performing exercises three times per week for 12 weeks. All participants in both groups will be evaluated before (Pre-time 0) and after (Post-time 1) the intervention. During the evaluations, samples and measurements will be taken, including fasting blood samples for BDNF and CTSB measurement, whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to assess global muscle mass, and magnetic resonance imaging of the quadriceps and brain. Global cognitive function will be evaluated using the ACEIII test, maximum strength with 1 repetition maximum (1RM), functional capacity with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (T-ADLQ). Finally, quality of life will be assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF scale. Expected Results: Few studies worldwide, and none in Chile, have evaluated the effects of resistance training on cognitive function, muscle mass, and strength gain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, or the correlation between increased muscle strength and cognition. There are also no protocols or clinical guidelines for resistance training in this at-risk population. The impact of resistance exercise on cognitive function in individuals with MCI remains unclear. The proposed research will provide new insights into the effectiveness of resistance training on cognition in individuals with MCI over 60 years of age.

NCT06473714,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a focal dementia characterized by primary impairment of language abilities and functional disturbances associated with language.

Although PPA is a progressive disorder, new techniques are being proposed to try to activate parts of the brain previously thought to be potentially inactive, due to the possibility of ""neuroplasticity"". This concept refers to our brain's modularity and learning potential. Transcranial direct current stimulation is a powerful neuromodulatory technique, in which a small current is applied to the participant's scalp through the targeted positioning of an anode and a cathode. The positive or anodal stimulation of tDCS is supposed to increase neuronal activity under the electrode, while cathodal stimulation is supposed to do the opposite.

This project will provide new insights into the nature of the neural activity underlying executive functions in people with primary progressive aphasia compared to those without. The investigators expect to find reduced amplitude of electrophysiological responses and lower accuracy in people with primary progressive aphasia compared with healthy controls. Given the results of previous studies showing the efficacy of tDCS protocols in the treatment of aphasia, the investigators might expect them to improve executive functions. If so, the investigators expect significantly greater electrophysiological responses after stimulation sessions compared with sham conditions. This project is of great clinical relevance. This research will improve current therapeutic protocols used in the treatment of PPA by providing critical findings on whether and how the use of tDCS improves executive functions. Crucially, the research will advance knowledge of executive function decline as a sensitive marker of PPA, informing us about the possibility of early detection of this disorder. At the same time, the investigators will analyze the possibility of controlling symptomatological evolution via the analysis of acoustic and vocal markers. This will enable us to observe the evolution of sensory markers such as acoustic markers according to symptomatological evolution. This will enable us to check whether acoustic markers correlate with the patient's level of symptomatological impairment and/or pathological physiological data.",30.466666666666665

The investigators will conduct the study in the emergency department of Maimonides Medical Center, an urban emergency department that receives over 120,000 adult visits annually. The emergency department is staffed on weekdays by salaried, trained, bilingual (English and Spanish) research associates who execute research studies under the supervision of the principal investigators. Adult patients between ages of 18 and 65 presenting to the ED with an acute exacerbation of a migraine without aura as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition criteria for migraine without aura or for probable migraine without aura, with an initial pain score of 5 or more on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale, and requiring oral analgesia as determined by the treating attending physician will be eligible for participation. Subjects' screening and enrollment will be performed by study investigators and research assistants. All patients will be enrolled at various times of the day when study investigators will be available for patient enrollment and an ED pharmacist will be available for medication preparation.

Each patient will be approached by research associates for acquisition of written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization after being evaluated by the treating emergency physician and determined to meet study eligibility criteria. When English will not be the participant's primary language, a language- appropriate consent form will be used and non-investigator, hospital-employed, trained interpreters or licensed telephone interpreter will assist in acquisition of informed consent. Baseline pain score will be determined with an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 to 10), described to the patient as ""no pain"" being 0 and ""the worst pain imaginable"" being 10.

Research associates will ascertain the subject's headache level every 30 minutes after medication administration for up to 120 minutes. If enrolled subjects required more pain medication at or after one hour had elapsed, they will be given additional medication at the discretion of the treating physician.

The research team will be contacting all of research subjects by telephone 24 hours after ED discharge to ascertain headache status, satisfaction with treatment, and presence of adverse events.

All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients' sex, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, and entered into SPSS (version 24.0; IBM Corp) by the research manager. Confirmation of written consent acquisition for all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the institutional biostatistician who will work independently of any data collection.

As a primary measure of headache intensity, the investigators utilized a standard, validated, and reproducible 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). This scale uses patients' responses in assigning their pain a number between 0 and 10, with 0 representing no pain and ten representing the worst pain imaginable. Secondary measurement scales included a standard four-point pain intensity categorical scale, in which patients describe their pain as ""severe"", ""moderate"", ""mild"", or ""none"" and a four-point functional disability scale, in which patients describe their headache-related disability as severe (""cannot get up from bed or stretcher""), moderate (""great deal of difficulty doing what I usually do and can only do very minor activities"" ), mild (""little bit of difficulty doing what I usually do""), or none. These scales will be used in accordance with the recommendation by the International Headache Society for use in migraine research.

One hour after medication administration, the investigators will ask all of enrolled patients if they needed more medication for pain. Lastly, we will assess enrolled patients' satisfaction (efficacy and tolerability of the study drug) with treatment by asking each of them, 24 hours after enrollment, whether they would want to receive the same medication the next time they visited the ED with an acute migraine.

The primary outcome for this study will be a comparison of change in numerical rating scale score between baseline and one hour between two investigational arms.

Secondary outcomes will include:

1. A comparative change in pain score between two groups at 120 minutes
2. A frequency of rescue analgesia at 60 and 120 minutes
3. Sustained headache freedom, defined as achieving a level of ""none"" on the severe, moderate, mild, and none scale within 2 hours of investigational medication administration and maintaining this level continuously for 24 hours without use of rescue medication.
4. Sustained headache relief, defined as change within 2 hours of the patient's description of headache from severe or moderate to either mild or none without use of rescue medication, and maintaining this level of relief continuously for 24 hours.
5. Headache relief in the ED, defined as change within 2 hours of the patient's description of headache from severe or moderate to either mild or none without the use of rescue medication
6. Headache freedom in the ED, defined as achieving a headache level of ""none"" within 2 hours without use of rescue medication
7. Achieving a normal functional status by two hours
8. The patient's overall assessment of efficacy and tolerability, expressed as a dichotomous response to the question ""Do you want to receive the same medication the next time you visit the ER with a migraine?""",30.433333333333334

NCT06480656,"Eccentric cycling exercise (ECC) allows training at low metabolic costs and may therefore be valuable for patients with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). For these patients, regular exercise training has an evidence level 1A recommendation in the current guidelines. Exercise training during longer and regular periods provides chronic adaptation, for which ECC was recently found to have a greater effectiveness than CON by increasing muscle strength, hypertrophy, six-minute walking distance and furthermore, by increasing maximum oxygen uptake (V'O2max) especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic left heart failure or coronary heart disease.

Furthermore, the investigators conducted an RCT in which the investigators exposed patients with PVD to ECC and concluded that ECC is a feasible and well-tolerated exercise modality for PVD patients with severely lower O2 demand and load to the right ventricle.

Therefore the aim of this project is to investigate whether ECC improves exercise capacity and possibly hemodynamics during prolonged rehabilitation programs in patients with PVD.",24.433333333333334

NCT06470906,"Transgender men (TGM) have a higher risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) associated with vaginal dysbiosis, such as HIV, HPV and bacterial N. gonorrhea and C. trachomatis compared to cisgender women (CGW). TGM on testosterone therapy (TT) also have increased vaginal symptoms. Vaginal dysbiosis can be characterized as clinical-BV or molecular-BV (i.e. based on vaginal microbiota profile). Both are known contributors to increased vaginal symptoms and STI risk in CGW. Low Lactobacillus (LL) levels determine molecular-BV and clinical-BV. Studies show that TGM on TT show that they have a primarily LL vaginal microbiota. The investigators are planning a future study to test the efficacy of an oral Lactobacillus probiotic to improve vaginal health.

The goal for the future study is to test an intervention that the investigators hypothesize may be able to ameliorate some of the adverse health outcomes observed in TGM on TT. Thus, the investigators propose to use an intervention of a mixture of two components: 1) the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus GLA14 and 2) the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001. Studies have shown that an oral combination of this intervention increases vaginal Lactobacillus levels and improves vaginal health in CGW. The future study will test whether this intervention is effective in TGM on TT. This specific study is a pilot study to be conducted prior to the future study detailed above. Here, the investigators will randomize 30 TGM on TT to receive the intervention or placebo for 4 weeks. The intervention in the pilot study will be the same as the intervention of the main trial and will consist of the probiotics 1) Lactobacillus acidophilus GLA-14 and 2) Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001. The placebo will be maltodextrin, the same as the proposed larger study. The investigators will assess the effect of the intervention on clinical-BV, molecular-BV (based on vaginal microbiota) and other clinical outcomes.

NCT06481397,"Study Intervention: All study patients will be assigned to receive treatment with the investigational device (Onco-Seraph 100).

Study Duration: Our target enrollment is 30 patients with PDAC. The study will last for up two years. Interim analyses will determine early stopping for safety. This is detailed in Section 23: Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Furthermore, as the safety and effectiveness of the experimental use of the ONCO Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter for treatment of patients with PDAC is unknown, patients will be followed for up to 5 years to inform oncological outcomes.

Procedure Setting: Extracorporeal blood purification utilizing Seraph can be performed either on an outpatient or an in-patient basis as HD/CRRT procedure is performed routinely in both settings. Whether the procedure will be performed in a setting of an outpatient or in-patient setting would mainly depend on the personalized approach that the Site Investigator choses related to individual patient enrolled in the study. Location of the Seraph treatment will be recorded, and data analysis will include consideration of the setting as it relates to study endpoints. If the Study Procedure is implemented in an outpatient setting subject will be monitored for additional 4 hours.

Procedure Duration for Onco-Seraph 100: A sufficient blood flow rate and exposure of patient's blood to the Onco-Seraph 100 adsorption media was initially established based on the experience in implementing procedure in patients with blood stream infections. However, target procedure duration is further optimized based on data collected in EU oncology patients as listed below:

The average procedure duration and blood flow rates targeted in patients with blood stream infections or oncology are as follows:

* At an average blood flow of 350mL/min, this would translate to approximately 5 hours of procedure time for patients with blood stream infection or 2.0hrs for oncology patient; an average of 200mL/min translates to a procedure time of 8 hours for blood stream infection or 3.5hrs for oncology patient.
* 1st stage: Study Procedure will occur only once, followed by weekly follow up visits through day 28, followed by monthly follow up through Day 60
* 2nd stage: Study Procedures will occur up to 3 times for the first week followed by once weekly for the following 3 weeks, for a total of up to 6 treatments over the first 28 days of study participation.
* Study Procedure(s) will be held, if subjects are hemodynamically unstable and unable to tolerate extracorporeal procedure (defined as MAP\<65 and/or sustained hypotension at enrollment as defined by two readings with systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements below 100 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measurements below 50 mmHg. The measurements must be performed thirty minutes from one another, and the Subject must be resting for at least 5 minutes prior to obtaining each measurement. (If the first reading includes a SBP greater than 100 mmHg and a DBP greater than 50 mmHg, the second reading does not need to be taken).

Subjects will be assessed per study visit and as part of routine, standard of care for PDAC. All subjects enrolled in this study will undergo clinical efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Blood, urine, and respiratory samples will be obtained at baseline, Day 1 Day 4, Day 7, 14, 21 and Day 28. Demographic and baseline clinical parameters will be recorded at the time of enrollment. Pertinent clinical parameters will be recorded on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and once on day 28. Outcomes data will be recorded on day 28 and at the time of hospital discharge or death. Subject status will be assessed at, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 28 or30, and 60 days to include adverse event evaluation and a targeted medication review. Survival status will be assessed 30 and 60 days after enrollment.

Patients will receive standard of care follow-up for up to 5 years and this data collected will be made available for FDA review.

A subset of the protocol team will review Grade 3 and 4 adverse event or serious adverse event (AE / SAE) data every 2 weeks. If there is a pattern of unexpected AEs that is out of proportion to the current understanding of the natural history of the disease, the DSMB will be asked to review un-blinded safety data in an ad hoc meeting. If an ad hoc meeting of the DSMB is convened to review a serious, device-related adverse event, enrollment will be halted pending the DSMB review to ensure subject safety in the trial. The DSMB will review the event to ensure subject safety. After the review, the DSMB will determine if enrollment may resume.

The DSMB will conduct an interim analysis after the enrollment of 10 subjects to evaluate for safety and efficacy prior to completion of enrollment (n=30) (as detailed in Section 23: Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)) and will be available for ad hoc reviews for safety concerns as described above. As stated above, enrollment will be halted pending the convening of an ad hoc DSMB meeting to review a serious, device-related adverse event.

The DSMB will review the event to ensure subject safety in the trial. The DSMB will determine if enrollment may resume. The DSMB may recommend temporary or permanent cessation of enrollment based on their safety reviews.

NCT06476743,"Previously the study was conducted to determine how sensory integration training affected older persons (aged 50 to 80) in terms of their ability to balance. Twelve healthy volunteers and eight people who had suffered a chronic stroke were included in this study. The participants were trained for six weeks. During standing and dynamic base-of-support exercises, repeated sensory training targeted visual and somatosensory inputs. The balance error scoring system, was used to evaluate standing balance both before and after training. With the exception of the most difficult condition (the single leg stand on a foam surface), there were no appreciable declines (improvements in balance) between pre and post-test for the healthy individuals. It was noted that the stroke participants' ability for balance had increased.

The study conducted in 2021 aimed at the comparison between the effects of virtual reality training (VRT) and conventional balance training (CBT) on the balance of the elderly. 36 elderly who are living in nursing homes were randomly divided into three groups: virtual reality training, conventional balance training and control group. Each group participated in a 60 min session, 3 times per week for 9 weeks. To assess the balance, the balance tests were used on single-leg stance (STS) with open and closed eyes, functional reach test (FRT), timed up and go test (TUG) and Fullerton advance balance scale (FABS). After the intervention the results showed that neither VRT nor CBT training method superior to other.

In 2020, a study was conducted to determine how combined strength and balance training affected the measurements of muscular strength and balance in older women who had previously had falls. Twenty-seven senior ladies were divided into two groups at random: the intervention group (IG, n = 12) and the control group (CG, n = 15). The IG underwent eight weeks of combined strength and balance training, consisting of three sessions per week with force plate visual biofeedback. .. At a rehabilitation facility, the CG got physical treatment and gait training. balance, and muscle strength (assessed by the sit-to-stand test, weight-bearing squat, which calculates the proportion of body mass supported by each leg at various knee flexions \[0Â°, 30Â°, 60Â°, and 90Â°). The modified clinical test of sensory interaction was utilized for balance assessments. This study shows that combined strength and balance training reduced sway oscillation in the IG and enhanced the percentage distribution of body weight between the legs.

Previously a study aimed to assess the efficacy of long term balance training with and without sensory augmentation among community dwelling healthy older adults. Twelve participants were randomly assigned into two groups. The experimental group received vibrotactile sensory augmentation through the smart phone balance trainers. While the control group performed exercises without sensory augmentation. Balance performance was assessed by using (activity balance confidence scale, sensory organization test, mini balance evaluation, Functional reach test, gait speed test, time up and go). After training the experimental group had significantly greater impairments in sensory organization test and mini balance evaluation systems test score than control group.

The study was conducted aimed to investigate the feasibility of a home based Wi balance training with mobile older stroke survivors. 14 persons participated in the study and were randomized to the training group (n=6) and the conventional balance training group (n=8). To get information about individual balance deficits that berg balance scale and dynamic gait index, ABC scale, timed up and go test (TUG) and a posturographic measurement were conducted. The results showed that unsupervised use of Wii balance board in the home environment seems possible and adequate for older stroke survivors with low functional limitation.

The study was to assess to which extent two similar skiing games challenge balance, as reflected in center of mass (COM) movements relative to their functional limits of stability (FLOS). Thirty young and elderly participants performed two skiing games, one on the Wii balance board (wiiski), which uses a force plate and one with the Kinect sensor (kinski), which performs motion tracking. During gameplay, kinematics were captured using seven opto electronical cameras. Subjects showed significantly larger maximal %FLOS displacement during the kinski game than during the Wiiski game. Furthermore, maximal COM displacement and COM speed in kinski remained similar or increased over trials, whereas for Wiiski it decreased.

Though, exercise is considered significant for older adults, most of the available literature and publications focuses on individual exercise interventions rather than directly comparing them. Thus, up to the author's knowledge, no studies have been found to compare how balance board training and sensory integration treatment affects functional mobility, postural stability, balance, and fall risk. Moreover, the literature on the relationship between improving balance and sensory integration is quite thin. Among latest researches, only fewer provide thorough procedures for sensory integration treatment and balance board training. Therefore, Present study aims to bridge this gap by optimizing exercise strategies and providing the evidence-based recommendations tailored to the unique needs of older adults.",7.033333333333333

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. It is proven to be highly effective to consolidate sleep. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) comprises of multiple components such as psychoeducation, stimulus control, time in bed restriction, cognitive therapy, and relaxation training.

Relaxation techniques such as mindfulness learn to redirect the attention to the act of breathing without changing it. Therein lies the difference with breathing exercises, where a person consciously changes breathing depth, pace or inspiration-expiration ratio. Several studies show activation of the parasympatic nervous system (promoting the rest-and-digest response) with breathing exercises. Furthermore, preliminary findings demonstrate feasible usage of technology supported breathing exercises with a tactile breath pacer, potentially leading to an enhancement in sleep quality.

NCT06474247,"Probiotics are live microorganisms that grant health effects to the host if consumed in sufficient amounts. Probiotic bacteria, which beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance, may affect the immune response, thus boosting the body system to combat against diseases. Meanwhile, postbiotic is an inactivated probiotic, probiotic-produced metabolites or their combination, which is capable of conferring beneficial effects to the host. Postbiotic has added advantages as compared to probiotic where inactivated cellular components remain potent though excluding any allergic factors, while the beneficial metabolites are applied directly to host upon administration and useful for applications such as skin topical use and intravaginal routes.

Vaginitis has been considered as one of the most common gynaecological conditions affecting women worldwide. Bacterial vaginosis and yeast vaginitis are two of three urogenital infections that affect as estimated one billion women in the world annually. The prevalence of vaginitis was reported to be varied from 5% to 50% among different study populations across major continents such as the United States of America, Europe and South Asia.

Vaginal candidiasis is one of the most common gynecological problems seen in primary care with Candida albicans account for 90% of the infection. The over-growth of this fungus in the vagina leads to a burning sensation in the vagina vulva, the production of heavy white/yellow curd-like discharge and/or an itchy vulva, puritus, dyspareunia, dysuria, irritation, soreness of the vulva and other discomforting symptoms that will ensure frequent hospital visits. The symptoms of vaginal candidiasis include vaginal itching or soreness, pain during sexual intercourse, pain or discomfort when urinating and abnormal vaginal discharge. Although most vaginal candidiasis is mild, some women can develop severe infections involving redness, swelling, and cracks in the wall of the vagina. It is also a most common form of fungal infection in pregnant mothers which may cause systemic infections in neonate particularly with low birth weight and prematurity after delivery.

Probiotics are preferred compared to antibacterial and antifungal drugs due to infection recurrence and drug resistance. It is a main concern that overuse of antibiotics could result in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungus. Therefore, it is vital to find other alternatives to treat vaginal infections.

The maintenance of healthy vaginal microbiota is important for optimal vaginal microenvironment. Jang and team reported that intravaginal administration of probiotic mixture increased the regulation of vaginal IL-10 and Foxp3. As this may be due to the probiotic regulatory effects on immune responses in the vagina. A clinical study from Norway and Sweden found that the treatment with antibiotics or anti-fungal medication in combination with probiotics provided long-term cure against recurrence of vaginal candidiasis as compared to the control.

During the past several decades, the many published surveys of vaginal flora specimens obtained from asymptomatic women have clearly shown that C. albicans may be present without the typical symptoms of yeast vaginitis. In a study by Glover and Larsen, the results of successive cultures of vaginal flora specimens indicated that Candida species may be present in stable association with the genital epithelium. Moreover, the majority of women who have vaginal yeast also carry the organism in the gut.

In women, vaginal candidiasis has been related to emotional stress and suppression of immune system which step up the risk of Candida species overgrowth and become pathogenic. In addition, another study involving 512 women with candidiasiss reported a substantial negative impact on quality of life, with 42% feeling out of control of their lives and 60% feeling out of control of their bodies. Forty-one percent indicated a severe impact on their sexual lives. Meanwhile, 30% of women with recurrent episodes of candidiasis have reported considerable morbidity and suffering. The summary scores of the SF-36 in topic of subjective health status and health-related quality of life among women with Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidosis (RVVC) in Europe and the USA also suggested that mental health was strongly affected by RVVC.

Current reports primarily emphasize on clinical effects of probiotics against candidiasis in women, with only few reports specifically on efficacy against recurrences. Very recent data are beginning to report on microbiota profiles of vaginal and feces of women with candidiasis, albeit rare. There have been no reports on these aspects from postbiotics. Information on proteins concentration, gene expression of vaginal microenvironment as affected by postbiotics against candidiasis are thus crucial. Thus, we hope that via this research, we are able to generate some scientific data for future knowledge on these aspects, for use of postbiotics as an adjunct treatment against VC and RVVC.",12.166666666666666
NCT06473428,"This study aims to investigate the effects of respiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, diaphragm excursion, and phonatory measures in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD often leads to weakened respiratory muscles, reduced diaphragm movement, and voice abnormalities, impacting breathing and communication. The study will recruit 45 patients with PD, who will be randomly assigned to three groups: an inspiratory muscle training group, a combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training group, and a placebo-controlled expiratory muscle training group. Over eight weeks, participants will perform daily training sessions, with the intensity of the exercises adjusted periodically. Assessments will include pulmonary function tests, ultrasound measurements of diaphragm thickness and movement, and various phonatory evaluations. The hypothesis is that respiratory muscle training will significantly improve respiratory and phonatory functions in PD patients compared to placebo, providing insights into effective rehabilitation strategies for enhancing their quality of life and communication abilities.",24.3
NCT06480292,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) significantly impacts maternal quality of life (QoL) and fetal/neonatal health. According to the World Health Organization, quality of life (QOL) is a person's view of their status in life within their culture and value system. Pregnancies with GDM, negatively affect personal, familial, and social life, leading to poorer QOL. GDM causes medical issues for the mother and fetus and harms the mother's psychological well-being, reducing her QOL. Due to the increasing prevalence of GDM and the importance of improving QOL for affected women, this study examines impact of telerehabilitation exercise on quality of life of pregnant women. Awareness about the importance of exercise in managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is crucial. Regular physical activity can help control blood sugar levels, reduce insulin resistance, and improve overall health for both the mother and fetus leading to better pregnancy outcomes.Telerehabilitation offers convenience, accessibility, and personalized support, allowing patients to exercise from home with continuous healthcare provider monitoring.It is a cost-effective, flexible, and safer alternative to traditional exercise methods, especially beneficial for managing gestational diabetes.

The control group will recieve routine medical care and the experimental group will recieve structured telerehabilitation exercise protocol. The results of both groups will be recorded and compared to assess the effectiveness of using telerehabilitation in the treatment of women with GDM in improving their quality of life.",6.1
NCT06470880,"Encorafenib and binimetinib given in combination (""the treatment"") is a standard of care treatment in the UK for late stage cutaneous melanoma, a skin cancer that starts in the cells that produce skin pigmentation. 'Late stage' means it can't be surgically removed, or has spread. The treatment is taken daily. Resistance to the treatment can develop after about 12-15 months. During this period, the treatment will kill the less resistant cells, meaning the tumour has a greater proportion of cells that are resistant to the treatment.

This study aims to investigate if the patient having breaks in their treatment allows the less resistant cells to continue to grow, this would result in a tumour with a lower proportion of resistant cells, making the tumour as a whole less resistant to the treatment, and increasing the time it takes for the disease to progress. A blood test that measures the amount of tumour DNA circulating in the patient's blood (known as ctDNA) will be conducted every two weeks to check if the cancer cells are still present, and if they are becoming active. The result of this test will allow doctors to monitor the activity of the tumour and judge when to pause and resume treatment. This intermittent treatment is called 'adaptive therapy'. The investigators intend to recruit 40 participants with late stage cutaneous melanoma from NHS hospitals in the UK. Ten will receive the standard, daily treatment, and thirty will receive adaptive therapy. Patients will receive their allocated treatment regimen until their cancer progresses, they or their doctor withdraw them from the study, or until the study ends, whichever happens first. As well as the fortnightly visits to hospital, patients will required to complete EORTC QLQ-C30 and PRO-CTCAE questionnaires in order for their quality of life to be assessed. These will be completed before their treatment starts; every 12 weeks from when they start treatment; and again if their cancer progresses.",24.33333333333333

NCT06471907,"The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a less invasive, safer, and technically easy alternative procedure to conventional neuraxial anesthetic techniques. In contrast to common neuraxial techniques such as paravertebral and epidural injections, the ESPB targets an interfascial plane which is far from the spinal cord, root, and pleura. First applied to thoracic neuropathic pain, currently ESPB is being applied to postoperative pain control and includes variable clinical situations. In the abdomen and thoracic wall, thoracic ESPB can be applied for pain control after cardiac surgery, video-assisted thoracic surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and thoracotomy. Recently, favorable postoperative pain control after lumbar spinal or lower limb surgeries has been reported with lumbar ESPB. In addition, ESPB has also been used for chronic pain conditions in the upper and lower extremities. To investigate the possible mechanism of action of the ESPB, many previous studies have focused on examining the physical spread of the injected agent. Commonly, contrast dye injections in human cadavers have been utilized to assess the spread level. Physical spread level was determined using various methods including direct dissection or sectioning, computed tomography (CT), thoracoscopic inspection, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with radiocontrast injection. Apart from human cadaver studies, physical spread level has been evaluated in alive patients using a variable volume of local anesthetics mixed with radiocontrast. Perfusion index is an indirect method which can present the degree of peripheral perfusion. Moreover, it is known as a more sensitive measurement tool than the rise of skin temperature. The apply of perfusion index is very simple and noninvasive. The degree of PI increase has been used to determine the success of peripheral nerve block. The volume of local anesthetics has been used 10-30 ml. However, most effective dosage with proper pain relief has never been suggested.",10.7

NCT06482372,"Stroke patients often have long-term upper limb dysfunction. Currently, there is still no specific clinical treatment for nerve damage. After acute treatments of stroke, patients' motor ability can only improve by spontaneous recovery of brain and rehabilitation treatment.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses a magnetic field pulse generated by a coil outside the skull to pass through the skull. It uses the principle that magnetic electricity can generate currents, which activates nearby brain areas or changing the relationship between the left and right brains. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive, safe treatment.

Mirror therapy is an emerging rehabilitation method in recent years. As mirror therapy, therapists ask the patient to place the affected hand behind the mirror while looking at the image reflected by the unaffected upper limb. During mirror therapy, patients have to perform upper limb activities and imagine that the affected upper limb is performing the same action.

As mentioned above, transcranial magnetic stimulation and mirror therapy improve the recovery of stroke patients by two different ways. Currently, there are no studies that combine these two treatments. Therefore, our study hopes to initially explore the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation and the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with mirror therapy.",27.366666666666667

NCT06479681,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is the third leading cause of preventable deaths in U.S. and accounts for over 10% of U.S. hospital admissions. Treatment for this population often fails to address the underlying cause of the hospitalization: the AUD. Patients hospitalized with alcohol-related medical complications tend to have high-risk for recurrence of alcohol-related medical problems, high rates of hospital readmissions, and poor recovery outcomes. Methods that promote long-term recovery care are needed. Inpatient linkage to peer recovery coaching may bridge this gap in care by providing a method of continued care for AUD recovery that offers flexibility in recovery pathways, peer modeling opportunities, and strong social support. Pilot study results demonstrated the feasibility of inpatient linkage to peer recovery coaching and showed evidence of decreased alcohol consumption, increased engagement in treatment and recovery support programs, and decreased emergency department visits. However, pilot study sample size, outcomes, and methods were limited. This proposal seeks to overcome these limitations and build on these preliminary results by: using ecological momentary assessments, measuring recovery using the new NIAAA definition, examining cost-effectiveness, assessing alcohol consumption using an additional objective measure (breath alcohol content levels), and examining social support and self-efficacy as potential mechanisms of effectiveness. This proposal will rigorously test the effectiveness of an inpatient peer recovery coaching service called the RC-Link program on recovery outcomes in patients hospitalized with medical complications from AUD. The program involves a bedside introduction to a peer recovery coach during the patient's hospitalization plus continued, recovery support for six-months. The RC-Link program provides standardized peer recovery service that is both personalized to the patients' needs and generalized to provide socioemotional, instrumental, and informational social support during every patient encounter. Aim 1 will determine the effect of the RC-Link program on frequency of heavy drinking, biopsychosocial functioning, and remission from AUD compared to controls. Aim 2 will examine how daily changes in perceived social support and self-efficacy influence alcohol consumption and determine whether such associations differ between the RC-Link and control groups. Aim 3 will examine the cost-effectiveness of the RC-Link program; hospital utilization rates will be examined as secondary outcomes. These aims will be evaluated using a two-arm randomized controlled trial that compares the RC-Link program intervention to a control group that receives a brief intervention and connection to a peer recovery coach after the study period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, monthly during the 6-month study period, and 6-months post- intervention. This study has potential to advance recovery care for AUD by providing a better understanding of how long-term, inpatient-initiated peer recovery coaching influences recovery outcomes over time in this population.",48.73333333333333
NCT06482333,"Eligible patients will only be randomly assigned to two different arms after total colonoscopy and polypectomy. The first group will recommence DOACs on Day 2 as recommended by current guideline (Late Resumption), while the second group will resume DOACs on the same day of the procedure (Early Resumption).

All procedures will be conducted by experienced endoscopists with more than 5-year of colonoscopy experiences All polyps detected will be removed, except for very large lesion that would require endoscopic submucosal dissection in which another session will be scheduled. These patients will not be enrolled in this study if polyp removal is not performed. A standard protocol for polypectomy will be adopted in this study. Polyps smaller than 3mm will be removed by cold biopsy forceps or cold snare polypectomy, while those between 3mm and 10mm will be removed with a cold snare. Polyps larger than 10mm will be removed by cold snare if feasible, but hot snare is also allowed for these lesions. Prophylactic endoclip would be applied to polyp \>=10mm in diameter; and can also be applied to smaller polyp subject to endoscopist's discretion as the benefits of prophylactic clipping is still uncertain in patients on DOACs. Photo-documentation of all polyps and their polypectomy sites would be required. Immediate bleeding during polypectomy, as defined as active spurting or continuous oozing despite observation for more than 1 minute, should be dealt with as usual practice with adrenaline injection, endoclips and thermocoagulation. These patients will be excluded from this study.

All patients will be followed up from the day of colonoscopy (Day 0) to Day 30. The patients (and their carers) will be given clear written and verbal instruction on the exact date of resumption of DOAC according to the group assigned (Day 0 or Day 2). Patients will also be given a list of warning symptoms to observe including bleeding (per-rectal bleeding or haematochezia), or thrombo-embolic events (stroke, chest pain and limb weakness or numbness, etc) for reference. They will be given a contact number for direct contact to the research team (during office hour) or are given advice to attend to the nearest emergency department in the presence of these warning symptoms. Patients will be contacted by research staff on day 2 and day 7 by phone to ensure their compliance with DOACs resumption schedule and any potential adverse event. A follow up visit at day 30 will be arranged for histological reports as well as any potential adverse events. All unscheduled medical attendance and hospitalization will be recorded up to Day 30. For patients who default on day 30 follow up, phone contact will be made, and their medical record will be searched through the electronic medical system of the Hospital Authority, which covers all public hospitals of Hong Kong, to look for any unscheduled emergency attendance and hospitalization

The safety committee will meet every 12 months unless requested by the study team due to emerging safety data.

A planned interim analysis will also be conducted after enrolling the first 100 patients to look for any safety signals or concerns, particularly if the bleeding risk in the early resumption group turns out to be much higher than the late resumption group. After deliberation by the safety committee, early termination of trial may be triggered if significant and persistent difference in outcomes between two groups occurs to an extent that patient outcome is affected.",24.33333333333333
NCT06472167,"Breathing exercises offer numerous benefits for individuals with chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and bronchiectasis. These exercises help improve respiratory function, reduce symptoms, and enhance the overall quality of life.Techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, incentive spirometer and pursed lip breathing help patients use their lungs more effectively. Breathing exercises can enhance lung function by increasing the efficiency of the respiratory muscles and improving ventilation. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways classified as intermittent or persistent (mild, moderate or severe), according to the presence of diurnal and nocturnal symptoms, necessity of medication, frequency of exacerbation, physical activity limitations and pulmonary function. All of these symptoms deteriorate in the patient's quality of life and psychological well-being and restrict daily living physical activities (DLPA). Asthma symptoms experienced during DLPA or the fear of triggering symptoms may keep asthmatic subjects from engaging in physical exercise, and the patients tend to be less physically active and less conditioned than healthy individuals. In addition, asthmatic patients have higher levels of anxiety and depression that have been shown to be associated with an increased number of exacerbations and the diagnosis of severe asthma. These psychosocial disorders can modify the respiratory breathing pattern, which leads to irregular breathing, frequent sighing, and predominant thoracic breathing. These irregular breathing patterns increase the number of respiratory (breathlessness, chest tightness and pain) and non-respiratory symptoms (anxiety, dizziness and fatigue). Recent GOLD guidelines (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) underline the importance of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) as a part of an integrative multidisciplinary approach regardless of the stage of disease",2.333333333333333
NCT06472219,"Introduction Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, third in China and second in Hong Kong. They are usually caused by bacteria or viruses and are associated with an early hyperinflammatory response. Evidence for the early detection of the disease and pathogen, risk-stratification and management are high priorities for the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The pathogens most likely to cause annual epidemics and pandemics are respiratory viruses although bacteria may cause up to 50% of ARI in hospitalised patients. Despite individual variation, the clinical course of ARIs generally involves an incubation period that lasts hours to days; and an early inflammatory prodrome which lasts days to a week and is characterised by symptoms such as a cough, fever, lethargy, headache (stage I). Whilst most patients recover, some progress to Stage II respiratory deterioration in the subsequent week; and Stage III severe respiratory failure may occur over subsequent weeks. The kinetics of bacterial and viral replication can last up to and even longer than 21 days. This prolonged and relatively slow progression provides several windows of opportunity in which early anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies could influence the course of the disease, reduce early hyperinflammation, facilitate recovery and well-being, and reduce hospital stay, disease progression, need for intensive care and mortality.

Usual care (UC) for patients with ARI presenting to EDs in Hong Kong is like other primary care settings in the world. For example, in Europe, early treatments are highly variable and consist of paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, low-dose corticosteroids, over-the-counter medicines, fluids, rest, time off school/work, and antibiotics or antivirals. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are rarely available in the emergency department (ED) and even after admission a pathogen may not be identified in up to 70% of cases. Thus, treatment is usually begun and continued without an identifiable bacterial and/or viral pathogen. As many ARIs follow generic hyperinflammatory pathways, evaluating and repurposing existing anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. prednisolone, 12) is a common and reasonable strategy which could have relevance not only for Hong Kong but worldwide.

Adaptive Platform Design and Response Adaptive Randomisation An adaptive platform trial is a trial in which multiple treatments for the same disease are tested simultaneously. New interventions can be added or replace existing ones during the course of the trial in accordance with pre-specified criteria. APTs offer innovations that could reshape clinical trials, and several APTs are now funded in various disease areas. APTs enhance research efficiency, shorten the duration of futile studies, and optimise sample size and study duration based on emerging data. The platform design allows for subsequent levels of randomisation if further treatments require evaluation.

The initial randomisation ratio is fixed 1:1 for a comparison between two trial arms, but the trial has the capability for these proportions to be altered according to participants' responses to interventions. Pre-specified decision criteria allow for dropping a treatment for futility, declaring a treatment superior, or adding a new treatment to be tested. If at any point a treatment is deemed superior to the usual care arm, the superior treatment may replace the usual care arm as the new standard of care.

Unmet Clinical Need Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) are a leading cause of death worldwide and in Hong Kong. There is relatively little evidence for early pathology- or pathogen-specific treatments for suspected community-acquired ARI (scARI). Every year, winter crises and epidemics are such that hospital wards, and particularly intensive care facilities, are frequently overstretched. Even treatments with moderate impact on survival or on hospital resources could be worthwhile.

One important area where evidence is scant is the role for steroids in scARI requiring hospitalisation. Although many trials report benefits of using steroids that outweigh AEs in severe COVID and CAP, the value in hospitalised patients with less severe disease, in scARI and early treatment (e.g. started in EDs) is unclear. Specifically, evidence for a safe role for early, low dose, short-course prednisolone to safely reduce excessive inflammation, progression to sepsis and mortality in adult patients with scARI is needed.

All patients will receive UC in the participating hospitals. Initially randomisation will be between two treatment arms:

Control Arm: Placebo Active Treatment Arm I: Prednisolone 30mg tablets administered once a day for five days.",36.46666666666667

NCT06482671,"Dyspepsia refers to chronic or recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms originating from the gastroduodenal region with a significant impact on patients' lives. Functional dyspepsia comprises the diagnostic categories of epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) with epigastric pain or burning and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) with meal-related fullness or early satiation, which are unexplained after routine investigation including upper GI endoscopy 2. Despite the common occurrence of FD in up to 15% of the general population, the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear and no treatments of proven efficacy are available in Europe for this condition.

Our group has demonstrated increased duodenal mucosal permeability and low-grade inflammation in FD patients, correlating with meal-related symptoms. The causes of the barrier defect and immune activation are unknown but candidates include psychological stress, luminal food components, (bile) acid and microbiota. The symptoms most closely associated with increased eosinophil counts in the duodenum are early satiation and postprandial fullness, which are typical PDS symptoms, and which are also associated with impaired gastric accommodation to meal ingestion and delayed gastric emptying.

Previously the efficacy of the Kampo medicine Rikkunshito (TJ-43) has been shown in FD. The exact mode of action remains to be determined. Previous studies have provided mechanistic evidence that rikkunshito is able to improve gastric accommodation, improve food intake and enhance circulating levels of the orexigenic gut peptide ghrelin.

NCT06482827,"Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, occurring in \~50% of patients (Juster-Switlyk \& Smith, 2016; Pop-Busui et al., 2017). DN results from damage to the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems (Feldman et al., 2019). Due to the damage to small peripheral nerve fibers, patients often do not properly perceive local traumas because of the absence of pain perception and vibration perception. The upper and lower limbs are the most commonly affected areas among individuals with DN, putting patients at a higher risk of developing skin ulcerations and undergoing amputations (Bondar \& Popa, 2018). DN is characterized by various symptoms including numbness, loss of sensation, tingling, weakness, pain, unsteadiness, loss of vibration sense and abnormal temperature (often cold) (Feldman et al., 2019). DN is associated with decreased quality of life, depression, sleep disturbance and anxiety (Callaghan et al., 2015; Sieberg et al., 2018). It is currently managed by the control of blood glucose levels, medications to relieve pain and symptoms, physical therapy and lifestyle modifications (Feldman et al., 2019). The global prevalence of DN is increasing, leading to a high incidence of lower limp amputations in the DN population, which accounts for approximately 70% of non-traumatic amputations worldwide (Bondar \& Popa, 2018). DN is also correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and leads to an increase in mortality of diabetic patients (Duran-Salgado \& Rubio-Guerra, 2014). Therefore, it is crucial to find new ways to improve neuropathy in patients living with DN.

A novel approach to treating neuropathy is through the induction of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to change, either through structural reorganization or functional changes in brain activation (Hallett, 2007). Neuroplasticity can be induced non-invasively with a form of brain stimulation known as repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS involves an electromagnetic coil placed against the scalp that generates magnetic pulses to induce electric fields in the brain. By delivering these electric fields in rapid succession and at low intensity, functional changes in the brain (i.e. neuroplasticity) can be evoked. rTMS can be used to treat neurodegeneration, blood flow change, autonomic nervous disorders, depression, and vascular endothelial injury. rTMS can produce inhibitory or excitatory stimulation of the cerebral cortex or specific areas, leading to remodeling of the nervous system. This makes it a promising application for promoting nerve regeneration, neuroprotection, and localization of injuries (Xu \& Xu, 2021). DN is closely related to cardiovascular disease as DN damages the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which controls heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) (Vinik et al., 2013). With rTMS, this damage in ANS, specifically, HR and BP, can be improved. Inhibitory stimulation can lower HR while excitatory stimulation can enhance heart rate variability. Both inhibitory and excitatory stimulation can lower BP (Lee et al., 2023). Thus, the use of rTMS can improve a variety of functions that could prevent further complications and possibly improve neuropathy, as well.

Inflammation is a crucial factor in the progression of DN, as it involves an increase in chemokine production, inflammatory cell infiltration in the kidney, tissue damage, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Duran-Salgado \& Rubio-Guerra, 2014). Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the kidney can lead to diabetic kidney disease, which is the most prevalent cause of terminal renal failure globally with suboptimal treatment options (Lim \& Tesch, 2012). Due to the close link between DN and inflammation, reducing inflammation has been suggested as a possible therapeutic option for this population. Additionally, diabetic wounds and inflammation are also associated, therefore controlling inflammation may improve wound management and healing rates (Pop-Busui et al., 2016). Researchers have recently discovered that rTMS can impact the levels of inflammatory markers (such as IL-1B, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Î±, TGF-Î², CRP, SP, and BDNF) in other conditions such as depression, post-stroke, and Alzheimer's (Cha et al., 2022; Velioglu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2019). The study by Zhao et al. (2019) investigated the effects of 20 sessions of rTMS intervention on 29 individuals diagnosed with refractory depression. Significant increases in serum BDNF levels and decreases in IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± levels were noted after one week of intervention, compared to healthy individuals, and this trend continued over the 4-week stimulation period. However, there was no change noted in the sham group. Cha et al. (2022) conducted a post-stroke study measuring the effects of 10 sessions of rTMS intervention on 10 individuals with post-stroke cognitive impairment. Following the intervention, levels of IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, and TGF-Î² mRNA decreased. Velioglu et al. (2021) explored the effects of 10 sessions of rTMS intervention on 15 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease. An increase in BDNF levels was noted following the conclusion of the intervention. Although no studies have been done in the DN population, the use of rTMS to examine changes in these levels is promising.

The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the use of rTMS to improve the symptoms of neuropathy in patients living with diabetic neuropathy.",12.166666666666666

NCT06478784,"Multiple sclerosis is a dysimmune and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Despite highly effective drug, multiple sclerosis represents the main cause of non-traumatic disability in young people. Interventions based on physical exercise have a positive impact on the course of the disease, although the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for this benefit remain unknown. This project aims to investigate the impact of physical exercise on neuronal destruction in patients with multiple sclerosis.

To do this, the investigators will study the evolution of the concentrations of two markers of neuronal injury, acidic gliofibrillary protein (GFAP) and light chain neurofilaments (Nfl) in two groups of patients: a control group and a second group subjected to a supervised resistance physical exercise program performed during 10 weeks. Marker values will be compared before and after the intervention and between groups. The results will allow the investigators to delve into the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and the mechanism through which physical exercise impacts on the disease. In addition, the investigators will generate knowledge that will allow us to reinforce the idea of integrating physical exercise as part of the treatment in multiple sclerosis.

NCT06479317,"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (Primary immune thrombocytopenia, ITP) is an acquired autoimmune hemorrhagic disease characterized with decreased peripheral platelet count and increased risk of bleeding. It has been reported that 33.3% -39.2% of ITP patients have positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in the course of disease.In the meantime, they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for rheumatic diseases such as lupus erythematosus(SLE). ITP patients with positive ANA are prone to relapse and chronicity. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new clinical treatments to attain longer-term remission in these patients.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has immune modulating role on a variety of immune cells.A clinical trial enrolled immune thrombocytopenia secondary to SLE, and ITP with positive anti-nuclear antibodiy (ANA) were treated with HCQ combined with glucocorticoids. The results showed an overall response rate of 60% (24 / 40), including 18 continuous complete response (CR) and 6 continuous response (R), and some patients had continued elevated platelet counts 3 months after treatment initiation. The above studies illustrate that HCQ contributes to the treatment of chronic ITP, especially as a long-term therapeutic agent with low economic burden and well-tolerated.

NCT06472388,"Everolimus toxicity can also be serious, requiring hospital medical assistance. In a study with more than 100 Latin American patients led by our group, approximately 20% of patients with NET treated with everolimus 10mg/day had serious infections, such as pneumonia, abscesses, pyelonephritis, with 7% developing opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis and pneumocystosis, requiring hospital admissions.

The rationale for testing 5mg/day comes from the results of phase I trials of everolimus, where a dose of 5mg/day was sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation by blocking the mTOR pathway.

Therefore, everolimus 5mg/day appears to have antitumor effects equivalent to 10mg/day, but it is less toxic than 10mg/day. Retrospective data from our center also suggest that 5mg is similar to 10mg/daily in terms of time to treatment failure in patients with advanced NETs (unpublished data).

Objectives:

* To evaluate whether everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/day may be as effective, but safer, as 10 mg/day in the treatment of patients with advanced NET.
* To compare progression-free survival and time to treatment failure between study arms
* To compare radiological response using RECIST v.1.1 criteria.
* To compare the frequency of grade \> 1 toxicities using CTCAE v.5.0.
* To assess tolerability by measuring the frequency and intensity of adverse events measured by the CTCAE version 5.0 criteria and the need for temporary or permanent interruption of everolimus.

Methods:

Randomized, open-label, phase II near-equivalence clinical trial of oral everolimus 5 mg vs 10 mg oral/daily and continuously in patients with Grade 1 or Grade 2 metastatic NET, with tumor progression or intolerance to at least one line of treatment and with radiological disease progression within 6 months.

Eligibility criteria:

Inclusion:

* Histological confirmation of well-differentiated Grade 1/Grade 2 NET from gastrointestinal, pancreatic, pulmonary or unknown primary sites.
* Metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable disease, measurable by images
* Disease progression by RECIST 1.1 in the last 6 months assessed by local investigators
* At least one previous line of systemic treatment (suspended for more than 3 weeks).
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2

Concomitant use of somatostatin analogues is allowed for patients with functioning NET.

Exclusion:

* Aggressive disease requiring cytotoxic therapy
* Severe/uncontrolled comorbid conditions that deem participant unfit for everolimus therapy, as per investigators' judgement.
* MiNEN

Procedures:

Randomization 1:1 will be performed centrally by RedCap software at AC Camargo Cancer Center, Sao Paulo, Brasil.

* Group 5 mg: participants will receive everolimus at a dose of 5 mg, orally, per day, continuously

NCT06483061,"Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common pathological finding in temporal lobe epilepsy.

While CA1 and CA4 subregions are typically affected, considerable variability in the involvement of the different subregions has been recognized between patients with specific hippocampal subfield pathology being demonstrated to predict surgical outcomes in medically refractory patients. Developing novel imaging biomarkers for hippocampal subfield pathology that can be obtained in vivo has the potential to allow more accurate prediction of surgical outcomes prior to surgery.

A major challenge in studying hippocampal subregions is the small size of the structures which are often smaller than the resolution of conventional MRI techniques. Cerebral blood vessels can be visualized with MRI using a variety of methods, some which do not require MRI contrast and others that do. The advantage of non-contrast methods is that subjects do not require intravenous contrast injections while the disadvantage is that the non-contrast methods are not capable of visualizing smaller vessels.

Recently high-resolution vascular imaging of the hippocampus using ferumoxytol as an MRI contrast agent has been reported by researchers at Wayne State University. It is believed that this method would provide the detail required to address the hypothesis that the microvasculature of hippocampal subregions is disrupted in temporal lobe epilepsy.

OBJECTIVES

The Specific Aims of this study are:

Aim 1: Implement ferumoxytol enhanced MRI imaging of cerebral vasculature with similar quality as compared to work conducted at Wayne State University. Aim 2: Compare hippocampal microvasculature density of hippocampal subregions between participants with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis and control subjects.

HYPOTHESES

1. Successful acquisition of susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) vascular imaging, with similar quality as compared to work conducted at Wayne State University, will be possible.
2. Participants with temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis will demonstrate reduced microvasculature in hippocampal subfields that will correlate with previously reported regional MRI changes.

METHODS /DATA ANALYSIS

AIM 1:

10 control subjects will be scanned using the Wayne State University SWI acquisition protocol. Participants will receive ferumoxytol diluted with normal saline administered by a Registered Nurse using an MRI compatible IV infusion pump.

NCT06482762,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania and/or depression. BD is the sixth leading cause of disability in the world and has been associated with significant financial costs of $151 billion. First-line treatments include medications like lithium and lamotrigine, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Unfortunately, close to half of individuals with BD do not adhere to treatment often due to side effects such as weight gain, sedation, and cognitive impairment. Therefore, identifying new tolerable treatments for BD patients would be worthwhile.

Individuals with BD show emotion dysregulation, which is associated with deficits in the corticolimbic network. Specifically, cortical brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, fail to regulate limbic regions, such as the amygdala, in BD. Pharmacological treatments for BD can decrease amygdala and increase anterior cingulate cortex activation during emotional stimuli, and increase amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex resting-state functional connectivity, which is correlated with clinical improvement. Literature has also consistently shown that amygdala volumes are reduced in BD with a significant negative correlation between amygdala volume and activation during emotional stimuli.

Neuromodulation has showed great promise in psychiatry. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been FDA approved for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has also been FDA approved for treatment-resistant OCD. These neuromodulation methods have advantages and disadvantages; TMS is noninvasive but is limited to modulating cortical brain regions (i.e., it cannot reach subcortical brain regions). DBS can stimulate deeper brain regions but requires invasive neurosurgery and long-term maintenance of the device. A newer neuromodulation modality is transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which noninvasively allows access to deep brain regions. We have completed a randomized controlled study of n=30 healthy individuals showing that tFUS targeting the amygdala can decrease amygdala and fear network activation during a threat-inducing task and resting-state functional connectivity. The reduction in amygdala activation was correlated with decreased self-reported anxiety.

Due to the amygdala's role in BD, we propose an initial feasibility study using tFUS to target the amygdala to change corticolimbic network activation during emotion regulation and amygdala-corticolimbic network resting-state functional connectivity in individuals with BD.

Specific Aims:

The specific aims of this proposed study is to explore the effects of amygdala tFUS on corticolimbic activation during an emotion regulation task in BD, to investigate the effects of amygdala tFUS on corticolimbic resting-state functional connectivity in BD, and to explore the relationship between tFUS-associated changes in amygdala activity and mood symptoms.

Subject Selection:

Twenty participants with BD aged 18-64 years old will be recruited. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will be used to to confirm a primary diagnosis of BD by a licensed psychologist.

Subject Enrollment:

Participants will be recruited through email announcements at MGH, internet website at Harvard, and flyers posted at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in the community (e.g., community centers, public libraries, coffee shops, restaurants, and laundromats). A phone screening will be performed to confirm likelihood that subjects will meet inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to committing time for further evaluation of eligibility.

Informed consent will be obtained prior to the performance of any protocol procedures. The informed consent will be used to explain in simple terms the risks and benefits of study participation. The nature of the study will be fully explained by the PI, co-investigators or specially-trained study staff. The subject will be encouraged to ask questions pertaining to their participation in the study and may take as much time as they feel necessary to consider his/her participation as well as consult with family members or their physicians. Participation in this study is voluntary and the subjects may withdraw at any time. The IRB-approved informed consent documents will be signed and dated by the subject and the person obtaining consent.

Study Procedures:

After providing study information and obtaining IRB approved informed consent, participants will complete up to seven study visits on seven different days.

Visit 0 (up to 1.5 hours) We will go through all portions of the consent form and answer any questions. The M.I.N.I. will be administered to determine if the participant has a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) will also be administered to confirm that participants are currently experiencing symptoms (BDI â‰¥ 14 and YMRS â‰¤ 12). The Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI) will also be collected to measure symptom severity. Participants will be excluded from further study procedures if they do not meet the above-described criteria.

Visit 1 (up to 2.5 hours) Participants will complete clinical assessments including the YMRS, BDI, CGI, and SAFTEE. Participants complete practice sessions of the MSIT computer task. Participants also undergo an MRI scan where we will collect functional scans including BOLD resting state, BOLD task based, and ASL scans. Participants also undergo tFUS sonication in the scanner. Psychophysiological measures will also be recorded during the MRI scan.

Visits 2 \& 3 (up to 1.5 hours each; spaced 4-7 days after the previous visit) Participants will complete the SAFTEE and will undergo tFUS sonication outside the scanner. Psychophysiological measures will also be recorded during sonication.

Visit 4 (up to 2.5 hours; spaced 4-7 days after the previous visit) Participants will complete clinical assessments including the YMRS, BDI, CGI, and SAFETEE. Participants complete practice sessions of the MSIT computer task. Participants also undergo an MRI scan where we will collect functional scans including BOLD resting state, BOLD task based, and ASL scans. Participants also undergo tFUS sonication in the scanner.

Visits 5 \& 6 (up to 1 hour; spaced 1 week and 1 month after visit 4) Participants will complete the same questionnaires from Visit 1.

Clinical Assessments:

During each study visit, we will administer measures of BD symptom severity (Young Mania Rating Scale) and impairment (Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale). Participants will also complete a self-report questionnaire of depressive symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory).

Multi-Source Interference Task:

Participants will complete an affective variation of the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT) where they will perform the cognitive interference task while viewing emotion-evoking images. We have used this task to investigate corticolimbic network activation in BD. During each trial, a three-digit number (using the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3) will be presented on the screen. Each trial will contain two identical distractor numbers and a distinct target number. Participants will identify the number that is different using a button press. During non-interference trials, the position of the different number is congruent with the position on the button box (e.g. 100, 020, 003), and is incongruent with the position on the button box (e.g. 221, 232, 331) during the interference trials. These numbers will be superimposed on positive, negative, and neutral images from the International Affective Picture System. Participants will complete this task in the MRI scanner before and after the first and last tFUS sessions.

tFUS: Participants will be fitted with the BX Pulsar 1002 (BrainSonix Corp). We will use Brainsight neuronavigation and fiducial markers attached to the transducer to determine the correct positioning of the transducer. The tFUS parameters are the same parameters we have been using in our previous and ongoing tFUS studies of the amygdala (Fundamental Frequency = 650 kHz, Pulse Repetition Frequency = 10 Hz, Pulse-Width = 0.5 ms, Duty Cycle = 5%, derated ISPPA = 14.4 mW/cm2, derated ISPTA= 720 mW/cm2). The sonications will be delivered in a 30-seconds on, 30-seconds off block design, for 10 minutes of sonication during each session. All participants will receive 4 sessions of tFUS over the course of 4 weeks (1 per week), which is the same schedule currently used for an ongoing amygdala tFUS for Generalized Anxiety Disorder study (2019P000562).

MRI Scans:

For the first and last tFUS session, participants will be scanned at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Engineering with a Siemens 3T Prisma MRI scanner. A high-resolution structural image will be acquired for co-registration of the functional images. We will collect blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) during the task (described above) and during resting-state before and after tFUS.

Psychophysiology:

Recording electrodes will be attached to the palm of the subject's left hand to measure galvanic skin response (GSR). GSR will be measured through disposable electrodes (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta CA) designed for use both inside and outside the MRI environment. Inside the MRI scanner, lead shield will be grounded through an RF filter at an MRI room to control room junction. For inside and outside the scanner the GSR Signal will be amplified and recorded with a BIOPAC Systems skin conductance module connected to a computer running AcqKnowledge software (BIOPAC systems).

Biostatistical Analysis:

fMRI BOLD task data will be preprocessed and analyzed using SPM12 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Images will be slice acquisition-time corrected, realigned to the first image of the pre tFUS MRI scan as a reference, co-registered to the individual's structural images, segmented into spatially normalized tissue maps, stereotactically normalized to the standardized space established by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI; http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca; ICBM NIH P-20 project), and smoothed/convolved with a three-dimensional Gaussian filter of 6 mm full-width at half maximum. Preprocessed images will be entered into first-level within-subject analyses. Realignment parameters representing movement in three translational and three rotational directions (x, y, z, pitch, roll, yaw) will be included as covariates to correct for motion. For each participant, contrast images will be created for conditions of interest for pre and post tFUS. A 2nd level random effects model will explore tFUS-associated changes during negative and positive interference trials compared to neutral non-interference trials in the amygdala and overall corticolimbic network from pre to post tFUS.

BOLD resting-state data will be preprocessed and analyzed using CONN toolbox with the amygdala as the seed region. Images will be realigned to a reference image, slice-time corrected, co-registered to standardized space, segmented, functional and structural images were normalized, and smoothed with a 8 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Movement in six different directions (x, y, z, pitch, roll, yaw) and an ART toolbox framewise displacement composite of motion will be entered as covariates. We will complete default denoising where the confounding effects of BOLD signal linked to white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and motion will be removed. Repeated-measures ANOVAs will be conducted to investigate whether tFUS is associated with significant changes in Fischer-Z transformed functional connectivity values between the amygdala seed region and corticolimbic network regions.

Exploratory bivariate correlations will assess whether tFUS-associated changes in the amygdala and overall corticolimbic network activity were correlated with changes in clinical scores and improvement.",18.266666666666666

NCT06482918,"Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric illness that has a significant impact on patients, their families, and society. It presents with deficits of different degrees in all cognitive domains, including memory, processing speed, attention and executive functions, which have been consistently demonstrated by different studies across several geographical regions. This has implications for patients' social functioning and quality of life, as cognitive symptoms together constitute the most important predictors of patients' functioning in the community. Antipsychotic drugs, although effective for psychotic symptoms, have little effect on cognition, however, cognitive rehabilitation achieves at least a medium effect size to improve cognition. There are at least two different cognitive remediation strategies, depending on the cognitive processes to which the intervention is targeted. One has a ""top-down"" approach, and is aimed at higher-order cognitive processes, and focuses on the training of executive functions. The other has a ""bottom-up"" approach and aims to first recovering the perceptual processing alterations that some patients with schizophrenia have and that would affect performance in higher-order cognitive functions.

This study addresses in parallel two research questions, one of clinical interest, and another focused on the psychological / neurobiological mechanisms of neurocognitive remediation: What neurocognitive remediation strategy, executive skills training (""top-down"" approach) or training perceptual approach (""bottom-up"" approach), is it effective in improving neurocognitive performance? Which neurocognitive remediation strategies are related to changes in BDNF levels? At what point of the recovery process are these changes observed? The hypothesis is that the ""bottom-up"" strategy presents observable results at the end of the intervention, whereas the ""top-down"" strategy results in an observable effect on neurocognitive performance and functioning in the community in a delayed manner, 12 weeks after the intervention. We expect that both strategies will be associated with an increase in BDNF levels compared to the situation prior to the intervention, but that this will occur at the time when the clinical effect is observed. The specific objectives are: (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of two cognitive remediation strategies, one focused on executive skills training (top-down approach) and another on perceptual training (bottom-up approach). (2) Study the critical moments of neuroplasticity for each cognitive remediation strategy, observing changes in BDNF levels at the end of the intervention and 12 weeks after the intervention. (3) Identify potential clinical and/or molecular predictors (BDNF levels or val66met polymorphism) of the response to treatment from the neurocognitive point of view for each cognitive remediation strategy.

In order to achieve this, two randomized controlled trials with two arms will be carried out in parallel, one where patients will receive cognitive remediation and another consisting of a control group (with usual treatment). The control group subjects will remain on a waiting and observation list for 10 weeks, to later enter the active arm, which will also last 10 weeks. In one of the trials the active arm will consist of cognitive remediation therapy with a ""bottom-up"" approach (focused on perceptual training), while in the other trial the active arm will consist of cognitive remediation with a ""top-down"" approach (focused on executive skills training). Neurocognitive and clinical assessments will be carried out along with the measurement of BDNF levels at four measurement times: one at baseline, one at the end of the observation period with treatment-as-usual, another at the end of cognitive remediation, and another after a 12 weeks follow-up period.",21.73333333333333

Candidacy for RFA is determined by the standard of care which includes diagnosis of axial low back pain without lower extremity radiation or other primary pain generators. These patients should not have had previous RFA's in the lumbar region before. These patients should receive greater than 80% pain relief following two diagnostic MBBs completed at separate times. In routine care, physicians discuss with patients the risks and benefits associated with the RFA procedure. In order to establish a baseline level of pain, disability, and impairment of daily living, patients are routinely asked to complete the PROMIS-29 questionnaire to the best of their ability. Once patients receive their second MBB they are to return 2 to 4 weeks later for RFA should they meet the necessary 80% pain relief. At the time of the procedure, a simple randomization performed by a staff member not involved in the patient's care, will be used to determine if the patient's procedure will involve the use of the Stratus Nimbus or the Stryker Venom electrode and cannula set. The provider performing the procedure will be made aware of which electrode is to be used. However, patients will be blinded to the group to which they were randomized. Patients will continue with conventional RFA as per standard of care. Patients will then be contacted at 1,3,6, and 9 months for assessment of response to intervention including the PROMIS-29 questionnaire. Scores are then compared to those taken at baseline to determine efficacy of treatment and inform future care.",12.166666666666666

NCT06471855,"It has been shown in the literature that most lower limb amputations are due to diseases related to vascular problems and diabetes, with different incidences depending on geographical region and ethnicity. There are various levels of lower limb amputation (LLA): from the fingertips or tarsal area; trans-tibial amputations, which involve the removal of part of the tibia and fibula; trans-femoral amputations, which are at the level of the femur; and hip amputations. Scientific literature and clinical experience suggest that the loss of a limb through amputation has a major impact on quality of life and physical and psychological well-being. Important are the repercussions on mobility and, specifically, the inability to walk has a negative impact on the performance of basic daily activities and reintegration into society. Amputation can also produce emotional disorders, leading to a change in levels of anxiety, depression, and pain, generating significant changes in the person's quality of life. Self-acceptance of a person with lower limb amputation is seen as a complex process, in which the prosthesis plays the role of a life-enhancing tool. Indeed, the prosthesis allows people to return to living life 'normally', increase their quality of life and restore their body image. Rehabilitation programs for amputees all have a common aim, which is to improve people's mobility and general functioning through the use of the prosthesis, that promote reintegration into the community and the overall improvement of these people's quality of life. In fact, the use of a prosthesis has a great effect on these patients as it attempts to contrast the negative impact of lower limb amputation in various areas: physical, psychological, and social. The prosthesis is considered not only as an enabling device, but also as a central component for personal and social identity. Over the last 20 years, rehabilitation has increasingly started to use high-tech components, such as robotic and virtual reality rehabilitation, both immersive and non-immersive. The use of technological components not only constitutes an innovative, accessible, and increasingly useful treatment tool, but is also recognized as an added value to traditional rehabilitation due to the positive impact it has on activities of daily living. Rehabilitation with virtual reality, consists of the integration to traditional rehabilitation practice of high-tech devices that allow multisensory stimulation and interaction with virtual environments, that simulate situations and contexts of daily life at different levels of immersion.

The psychological processes characterizing this clinical population are still poorly investigated and here are few studies using rehabilitation with high-tech instruments on patients with prostheses after LLA.

Following this line, the purpose of this prospective study protocol is to explore changes and evolutions in the psychological and behavioural adaptation constructs in patients at high vascular risk of LLA, already amputated or undergoing prosthesis adaptation; these ones receiving traditional rehabilitation treatment and technology-based rehabilitation (experimental) or not (active comparator) with randomized controlled enrolment. This quali-quantitative study project comes from the need to have a holistic vision of the patient acceptance process in the various phases of the disease and of the factors involved in the process of adaptation to the prosthesis, analyzing the state of health.

Specifically, the study objectives are:

1. to analyze HRQoL, psychological and behavioral adaptation in patients at high vascular risk of LLA, already amputated or undergoing prosthesis adaptation.
2. to present a multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention model, traditional rehabilitation vs traditional rehabilitation with technology-based rehabilitation, and study its impact on the HRQoL in patients with prostheses (only trans-tibial amputations).",19.3

After spine surgery, patients need good analgesia. Peripheral nerve blocks have provided a safe, effective method to control early postoperative pain when symptoms are most severe.

Local anaesthesia's much lower toxicity threshold makes it essential for its safety. An effective adjuvant, such as Dexamethasone or Dexmedetomidine, could allow for a higher dilution of local anaesthetics while maintaining and enhancing their analgesic effect.

NCT06472193,"Management of bladder dysfunction was revolutionized by the introduction of intermittent catheterization by Lapides. Later, Mitrofanoff described a trans-appendicular continent cystostomy, launching a new concept whereby the bladder could be emptied by a route other than the urethra.

Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is one of the main tools for neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction management, as it provides adequate bladder emptying and protects the upper urinary tract from high pressures, hence preventing progressive renal damage.

Despite its important role, CIC is difficult to perform in various situations: lack of manual dexterity, female wheelchair patients, body habitus, anatomical morbidity due to extensive surgery or psychological problems. For such patients, continent urinary diversion (CUD) is a viable option for bladder emptying optimization.

NCT06473805,"A smile plays an important role in determining a person's initial impression and its assessment has become integral to clinical evaluation owing to how appealing a smile could be among people. A gingival smile, gummy smile or high smile line is an aesthetic concern with 10-12% prevalence among dental patients mainly in women and is diagnosed when a patient shows â‰¥3 mm of free gingiva.

A gummy smile may result from a single cause but is more commonly found to be the result of an interplay of multiple factors and identifying the causative factor is the basis for its treatment. It may be broadly caused by dentoalveolar discrepancies or non-dentoalveolar discrepancies. Dentoalveolar discrepancies include short clinical crowns, altered passive eruption and gingival hypertrophy/hyperplasia. These discrepancies can be improved by restorative and periodontal approaches. Non-dentoalveolar discrepancies include hyperactive upper lip, short, or incompetent upper lip and vertical maxillary excess. Orthognathic surgery, lip repositioning (LRT), orthodontic treatment, and Botox injections are the main treatment modalities typically employed for treating thesis conditions.

LRT, first described by Kostianovsky and Rubinstein in 1976, has shown excellent efficacy in treating gummy smile, showing an average reduction of 2.71 to 3.4 mm at 6 months of follow-up in previous systematic reviews. However, the traditional technique has reported different partial or complete degrees of relapse. Therefore, different modifications have been developed to improve the predictability and stability of the technique and reduce morbidity and complications.

Most modifications reported in the last 5 years aim to provide improved stability of outcome by introducing techniques that eliminate or restrict the function of the muscles responsible for raising the upper lip during smile or that alter/restrict the hypermobility of lip movement. Some of these techniques include the use of adjuvants such as botulinum toxin (BOTOX).

Injecting overactive muscles with measured amount of botulinum toxin results in a reduction of muscle activity, relaxation of the lip muscles and decreasing upward pull on the lip. The improvement achieved is almost immediate but remains only for a period of 3-6 months, before slowly fading. This relatively short duration is the major disadvantage of the technique, that require constant reapplication and the effects of long-term use of Botox have not been adequately researched

Other approaches, such as the incorporation of muscle resection or the introduction of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implants are intended to have a permanent effect. PMMA is a cross-chain polymer material compatible with human tissues, and since World War II it has been utilized in medicine, for cranioplasties in neurosurgeries, secondary to decompressive craniectomy. It is still the most used reconstructive material by many clinicians because it is one of the most available biocompatible alloplastic materials that elicit low foreign body reaction and provide adequate protection to adjacent neural tissues. Its first application in dentistry was for full dentures and it has shown promising results such as good biocompatibility with the oral tissues.

PMMA bone cement can also be used as graft material for extraction sites, furcation lesions, correction of maxillary and mandibular contours and in 2017, Torres et al. published the first study in which PMMA was used for sub nasal depression in cases of vertical maxillary excess. To restore deficient thickness of alveolar bone and perform adequate lip support, PMMA was directly modified and adapted on the bone surface. Another study in 2018 and 2024, Conventional full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps had been used to obtain access to the labial alveolar bone surface, to place and secure the PMMA device with fixation screws.

To overcome intraoperative complication such as incomplete polymerization, exothermic reactions, low physical properties and prolonged operation time, a new approach using 3D print for the use of PMMA cement to decrease lip movement, reposition the upper lip and decrease the gingival exposure. In 2023, de Castro et al., described alternative technique to treat gummy smile with minimally invasive vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA) and PMMA implants for lip repositioning. Although the published case reports have shown good outcomes for this specific indication, there is a need to better codify the indications for the procedure and to have stronger clinical evidence to support its use.

In addition to PMMA, Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) has become a hot topic for new material research due to its good biocompatibility, excellent fatigue properties, excellent mechanical properties, high toughness, relatively low wear rate, corrosion and aging resistance, ease of processing, and color stability. Additionally. Recently, 3D printing has been used to manufacture PEEK scaffolds and prostheses. This technique can produce more precise and complex end products.

Considering its advantageous physical properties and the low rate of postoperative complications reported in the literature, PEEK is a reliable biomaterial for patient-specific implants in facial recontouring as has been described as part of reconstruction of skull defects and those in the orbital-maxillo-zygomatic district, both in post-traumatic and in post cancer situations. However, fewer reviews have provided a through summary about the recent advances in PEEK for a variety of dental applications.

Future research should focus on the impact of different materials of bone cement grafts whether PMMA or PEEK to manage the gingival smile in facial profile at rest and during smiling, thereby enabling the understanding of some of the possible side effects of this intervention.",13.166666666666666

NCT06474689,"Feeding and Eating disorders (FEDs) have been claimed to represent major global health concerns. FEDs include different types of disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and Binge Eating Disorder (BED), which are all generally characterized by excessive preoccupation with body shape, eating, and weight, and may include disordered eating and compensatory behaviors.

BED is a relatively new FED introduced in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It is characterized by frequent episodes of eating a large amount of food in a short period of time and with a sense of lack of control over eating, followed by a sense of guilt, not associated with compensatory behaviors such as vomiting.

There are several medical comorbidities with FEDs which can range from cardiac to metabolic, gastrointestinal, and reproductive complications. BED is associated with severe medical conditions including, among others, obesity and obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

FEDs often present with psychiatric comorbidities. The most common FEDs-related psychiatric conditions are anxiety disorders (particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia), mood disturbances such as major depression, and alcohol and substance abuse.

Treating FEDs requires a multidisciplinary approach with medical, nutritional, psychological and physical interventions. As far as psychotherapy is concerned, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), in particular the Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E), has been recognized as the treatment of choice for FEDs. Although CBT-E is the most used approach to treat FEDs, there is some evidence suggesting weak long-term outcomes such as high percentages of dropout and unsatisfactory remission rates. These findings have motivated researchers to investigate the role of psychopathological mechanisms not adequately addressed by CBT-E, which can have an impact on the onset and the maintenance of FEDs.

History of trauma and early negative experiences in life such as neglect and abuse as well as stressful life events have been recognized as common risk factors for FEDs, and as predictors of worse treatment outcomes when not properly targeted. Since CBT-E does not specifically target trauma-related symptoms, it can be hypothesized that the treatment of FEDs could benefit from a trauma-focused therapy.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a trauma-focused therapeutic approach developed by Shapiro in 1987 for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and traumatic psychopathological features as dissociation. To date, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported EMDR to be effective in the treatment of PTSD and trauma-related comorbidities.

Because trauma history is prominent in FEDs, and EMDR has proven efficacy in the treatment of trauma and trauma-related disorders, some authors have argued that EMDR could be a beneficial approach to be used for the treatment of FEDs. However, only a few studies addressing this hypothesis are available. For example, Zaccagnino and colleagues illustrated a clinical case in which a 17-year-old inpatient with unremitting AN followed an EMDR intervention for 6 months in hospital. From pre-to-post-treatment, the patient increased weight, and BMI, improved her attachment style, and increased self-confidence and social functioning, and results were maintained at 12 and 24 months follow-up. ErgÃ¼ney-OkumuÅŸ described the positive effects of EMDR on a patient with BN, who received 20 sessions of CBT-E followed by 5 sessions of EMDR with a focus on body image. After the intervention, the patient reported important improvements in eating-related symptoms (binge eating, restricting, and preoccupation with weight, shape, and eating) as well as motivation, body satisfaction, and social relations.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no evidence concerning the efficacy of EMDR in the treatment of subjects with BED. For this reason, a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) with a mixed between-within design was planned in order to test the superior efficacy of a 4-week EMDR intervention compared to a parallel CBT intervention in the treatment of inpatients with BED and comorbid obesity, and who experienced traumatic events in their lives.

The EMDR intervention was hypothesized to be more effective than the CBT intervention in reducing the impact of traumatic experiences, BED symptoms, emotional eating, and psychological distress, and in improving emotion regulation.

The RCT is ongoing at the IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Piancavallo (VCO, Italy), a third-level, residential clinical center for the rehabilitation of obesity and eating disorders.

Patients attending the inpatient program described below are screened for inclusion into the RCT during the first hospitalization week. After a routine clinical interview conducted by an independent licensed psychologist, patients who meet the eligibility criteria are invited to participate in the RCT by a member of the research team, who informs them about the RCT objectives and procedures.

Once the safety of the BC1 cell line alone has been demonstrated in Phase 1, in Phase 2, patients will be treated with the Bria-OTS regimen (see below) and a check point inhibitor (CPI).

During the monotherapy phase of Phase 1, one patient will be treated intradermally every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (4 doses) with an initial dose of the BC1 cell line. If this dose is tolerated, the next patient will receive an increased dose of BC1 cells. If once again tolerated, the third patient will receive a further increased dose of BC1. Once at least 3 patients have been safely treated with the BC1 cell line, with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the combinational phase of the study will commence.

Following the monotherapy phase, patients will be treated with BC1 and the Bria-OTS regimen (see below) every 3 weeks, plus a CPI at the FDA approved labelled dose and schedule. There will be at least a 2-week spacing between enrollment of each of the first three subjects in the study in order to assess for any early unanticipated risk(s).

During the Phase 1 combination and Phase 2 expansion phases, all patients will be treated with BC1 cells as part of the Bria-OTS regimen, which includes cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 2-3 days prior to BC1 cell inoculation, and peginterferon alpha-2a administered on the same day, following BC1 cell inoculation.

Imaging studies will be performed at screening for baseline prior to first treatment; after the completion of the monotherapy phase just before starting the combination phase, and subsequently every 9 weeks for the first 6 months then q12 weeks thereafter while on treatment.

Patients who develop progressive disease on imaging, may remain on treatment as long as the Investigator feels they are deriving clinical benefit and there is no reasonable, meaningful, clinical alternative therapy available. Subjects will continue to be followed for time on subsequent therapy (PFS2) and survival by phone call or medical record review, every 3 months for up to 2 years.

Study Drug, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:

The Part 1 monotherapy phase of Phase 1 will proceed as follows for each patient:

Subject 1, Q2w for 4 doses Subject 2, Q2w for 4 doses Subject 3, Q2w for 4 doses

Initially, safety will be assessed on these 3 subjects. DLTs are defined as CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that are suspected to be possibly related to study treatment.

If 1 of 3 Phase 1 subjects experience a DLT, that dose cohort will be expanded to another 3 patients before the combinational phase begins. If none of the patients in the expanded cohort experience a DLT (DLT rate of 1/4), the study will move into Bria-OTS and CPI combination. The dose for the combination will be either the highest dose at which no DLT is observed among the first 3 patients or the 3 patient expanded cohort dose level. In Phase 1, DLTs for determining the combinational BC1 dose will be observed until the first scheduled assessment. If the Phase 1 DLT rate is â‰¥ 2/4, an additional 3 patients will be dosed using the next lower dose level or 10 million cells (whichever is higher). If none of the 3 subjects experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), that determined BC1 MTD dose will be included in the Part 2 combinational phase of Phase 1 along with a CPI. If a tolerated dose for BC1 cell line cannot be identified, further investigation will be paused, the data reviewed and may resume at a lower dose only with protocol amendment and IRB approval.

Following the Phase 1, Part 1 monotherapy phase, 3 patients will be treated every 3 weeks with the Bria-OTS regimen with a CPI in the Part 2 combination phase. The Bria-OTS regimen consists of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 2-3 days prior to BC1 cell line inoculation. On the same day as the cell inoculation, subjects will receive peginterferon alpha-2a. Subjects will also receive the CPI on the same day of the cell inoculation according to approved dosing.

Once 3 patients have been safely treated with the Bria-OTS regimen and CPI for 2 cycles, Phase 2 will enroll an expansion cohort, consisting of up to an additional 9 subjects (for a total of 12 treated with the Bria-OTS regimen and CPI).",11.1

NCT06474871,"Background Virtual Reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated digital environment that can be experienced and interacted with as if that environment were real. VR systems are typically classified as immersive, semi-immersive, or non-immersive, with immersion referring to the level of user perception with regard to being in a virtual environment (VE) rather than the real world: immersive VR systems supply VEs with a changing field of view via head-mounted displays, and in which movement is achieved via hardware such as head trackers, hand controllers, and body motion sensors; semi-immersive VR refers to systems that use projection-based systems (e.g., driving simulators and use of shutter glasses); non-immersive VR systems include basic desktop displays and videogames.

Considerable evidence exists for using VR for rehabilitation of acquired brain injury (ABI), with a particular focus on stroke. The benefits of VR for ABI rehabilitation seem to include enhanced ecological validity, the ability to maintain experimental control over assessment and treatment standardization, and the control of task complexity. Indeed, VR can provide relatively naturalistic VEs for repeated practice of functional tasks such as activities of (instrumental) daily living which may assist with generalizing targeted skills. VR can also enhance patient motivation and active participation thanks to visual and auditory feedback, which is necessary for neurorehabilitation. Furthermore, VR tools offer the possibility to adapt the exercises to the patient's capabilities and needs and monitor their performance.

However, to date very little evidence has been collected in patients with ABI with different aetiologies (i.e., traumatic or anoxic brain injury) and level of severity (i.e., sABI). Moreover, current evidence provides some support for using VR for ABI rehabilitation, but the quality of the evidence is relatively low, and many studies include non-immersive and semi-immersive systems rather than focusing on immersive VR technology. For instance, a recent study44 investigated the effects of non-immersive VR-based training to improve executive abilities in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Executive dysfunction is among the most common facets of cognitive impairment following TBI, involving about 48% of moderate-to-severe TBI patients. Patients received either the standard cognitive training (i.e., paper and pencil) or the VR-based cognitive training. The authors found that all patients improved their global cognitive and executive function, even though those treated with VR achieved better outcomes44. Although this study showed that VR cognitive rehabilitation can be a promising tool to improve executive functions, further studies are needed to confirm the value of VR in sABI. The present multicentre study aims to overcome current literature issues as heterogeneity of populations and outcomes, small sample sizes and a lack of randomized controlled trials, which can affect the level of evidence and generalizability of results.

Methods Study type: interventional Allocation: randomized Intervention model: parallel assignment (1:1) 28 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 30 minutes of VR or TCT sessions at the same time each day throughout the experiment. 20 VR or TCT sessions will be applied, 5 per week for 5 weeks. Both groups will receive an additional 60 minute-comprehensive daily rehabilitation programme in the 3 months of the study. This programme consists of active limb mobilization, training on different cognitive domains, occupational therapy, language and swallowing therapy based on the patient's functional condition.

NCT06471777,"Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is almost uniformly complicated by fluid accumulation, often leading to fluid overload. Congestion resulting from fluid accumulation is believed to contribute to organ failure. Removal of excess fluid is a central component of dialysis treatment, also known as kidney replacement therapy (KRT). However, there remain important knowledge gaps in our ability to remove excess fluid effectively and safely. If fluid is removed too slowly, fluid overload and its complications persist for longer. If fluid is removed too fast during KRT, patient's blood pressure may drop (ie hemodynamic instability may occur) which may precipitate complications.

The optimal fluid management strategy is currently unknown.

The PROBE Fluid UK study is a randomized clinical trial comparing a protocol-based fluid removal strategy with usual care in critically ill patients with AKI receiving KRT. The fluid management protocol is intended to achieve neutral or negative daily fluid balance by both preventing and treating fluid accumulation.

NCT06478940,"Due to the complexity of the root canal microbiome, it is doubtful that they can be treated properly with a single antibiotic. Accordingly, a combination of multiple antibiotics seemed to be essential to diminish different types of pathogenic bacteria. Recently, a combination of three antibiotics (Metronidazole, cefixime, and Ciprofloxacin) along with Statins (new bio-inductive materials in regenerative dentistry) has shown promising results in primary teeth pulp therapy.

Statin components have an anti-inflammatory impact on pulp tissue by lowering the amount of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. They also decrease osteoclastic processes and strengthen osteoblastic processes. Thus, they promote bone regeneration and dentin formation by enhancing odontoblastic activity. Several studies have shown a clinical and radiographic success rate of 3Mixtatin with inconsistent results.

NCT06470516,"Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder characterized by a high suicide rate and significant disability. Cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, with approximately 98% of patients experiencing a decline in cognitive function compared to pre-illness levels. Research has found that individuals with schizophrenia show significant impairments in seven domains, including reaction time, attention, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, logical reasoning, and social cognition.

Pharmacological treatment remains the primary approach for managing schizophrenia. However, cognitive impairment in individuals with schizophrenia often does not respond well to medication. Additionally, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may have potential cognitive side effects. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a form of noninvasive brain stimulation, has been found in several studies to improve cognition. However, its effectiveness is not yet clear.

Conventional tACS utilizes weak currents below 4mA, which can only directly stimulate certain cortical areas and indirectly stimulate deep brain structures. Moreover, the targeting of specific brain regions can be complex, and users may experience a sensation of heat on the skin where the electrodes come into contact.High-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (Hi-tACS) employs electrical currents greater than 10mA, typically ranging from 10-15mA. Unlike conventional tACS, Hi-tACS can apply stimulation to the entire brain, potentially enhancing its therapeutic effects. Moreover, Hi-tACS does not require precise targeting and is generally well-tolerated without any discomfort during the stimulation.

NCT06479824,"Study Description:

Functional tricuspid valve regurgitation is common, has high morbidity and mortality, and has no good treatments. We developed a new transcatheter treatment for this orphan disease called TRAIPTA (Trans-Atrial Intra-Pericardial Tricuspid Annuloplasty). In TRAIPTA, catheter tools cross the wall of the heart to enter the pericardial space surrounding the heart, encircle the heart around the atrioventricular groove, and apply tension to reshape and narrow the heart to help the leaky tricuspid valve to function better. After placing the belt, a closure device is deployed to close the puncture in the right atrial appendage.

This is the first human test of the TRAIPTA technique. It is offered to patients who are suffering from clinically significant tricuspid valve regurgitation and who have no other good treatment options.

Objectives:

The objectives of this study are to test whether TRAIPTA is feasible, safe, favorably remodels tricuspid annular geometry, and reduces severity of functional tricuspid valve regurgitation.

Primary Safety Endpoint:

The primary endpoint is safety, measured as a composite of freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) assessed at 30 days after the TRAIPTA procedure, including all of the following:

* Stroke (disabling and non-disabling)
* Device-related pulmonary thromboembolism (symptomatic)
* TRAIPTA-related coronary compression requiring coronary revascularization or post-procedure relief of TRAIPTAcompression
* Pericardial tamponade. Note that insertion of a pericardial drain and pericardial effusion requiring drainage is an expected part of the TRAIPTA procedure, and does not contribute to the primary safety endpoint.
* Major cardiac structural related complications including cardiac surgery related to the device.
* Major access site and vascular complications
* Acute kidney injury requiring new renal replacement therapy.
* Bleeding (major or worse) according to MVARC

NCT06473480,"Glucose control in surgical patients with diabetes is essential to prevent hyper- and hypoglycemia, which can lead to infections, poor surgical outcomes, prolonged hospital stays, and death. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among patients in Denmark in 2022 was 6.2%. The global incidence of diabetes is increasing, resulting in a rising number of patients requiring glucose control during admission to surgical wards.

Glucose control through point-of-care fingerstick capillary glucose monitoring (FSGM) is standard in many hospitals. However, FSGM can be painful, disrupt sleep, and increase patients' postoperative stress. Additionally, it can be time-consuming and require up to two hours of work for nurses per patient daily. Consequently, maintaining timely and prescribed glucose monitoring can be challenging in busy surgical wards, leading to untreated hyper- and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, FSGM provides only a snapshot of glucose concentration and does not indicate whether glucose levels are stable, increasing, or decreasing.

An alternative to FSGM is continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), which measure glucose levels via a subcutaneous sensor every few minutes. CGMS is primarily used in ambulatory settings, and studies have reported improved regulation of glucose levels. In surgical and medical wards, several studies have confirmed the accuracy of CGMS compared to FSGM, with reported mean absolute relative differences ranging from 9.4 to 12.9, making CGMS suitable for surgical wards.

Other studies on CGMS in surgical and medical wards have reported a decrease in mean glucose levels, increased detection of daytime hyperglycemia, and decreased occurrences of nocturnal and prolonged hypoglycemia compared to FSGM monitoring.

Some studies have explored patients' perspectives on CGMS, mainly in everyday life and outpatient settings. One study showed that women with type 2 diabetes monitored their glucose levels more closely with CGMS and took more initiative to regulate food intake, activity, and stress levels, consistent with findings from a review of the same patient group using CGMS. In another study involving patients with type 2 diabetes aged 53-72 years, patients found the technology helpful in disease management but also considered it an unpleasant reminder of disease progression, and the sensor could cause discomfort.

A few case reports have described nurses' experiences with CGMS in hospital wards with patients with type 1 diabetes. Nurses reported an increased workload because the device receiver next to the patient was difficult to hear, leading to more frequent patient observations than usual.

In summary, studies of CGMS have shown safety and benefits in ambulatory settings, but challenges and knowledge gaps in hospital wards remain. To date, no studies have compared glucose levels from CGMS with those from a laboratory plasma glucose analyzer as the reference.

Seven substudies will be conducted:

Substudy 1 - Glucose levels and management for surgical patients in relation to hospitalization: Compares glucose levels and management using point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS during hospitalization and FSGM and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) up to three months after discharge.

Substudy 2 - Patient satisfaction with glucose monitoring and management in surgical wards: Compares patient satisfaction with glucose monitoring and management for surgical patients using point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS during hospitalization.

Substudy 3 - Nursing staff's glucose monitoring and management workload in the surgical ward: Compares the nursing staff's workload with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS for surgical patients.

Substudy 4 (qualitative study) - Patient experience of glucose monitoring and management in relation to hospitalization in surgical wards: Compares the patient experience with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS and glucose management during hospitalization in the surgical ward and compares the patient experience of FSGM with CGM after discharge.

Substudy 5 - Continuous glucose level for surgical patients during hospitalization in the surgical ward: Compares the continuous glucose levels when glucose monitoring and management are performed by point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS, respectively.

Substudy 6 - Accuracy of CGMS for surgical patients during hospitalization: Investigates the accuracy of CGMS by comparing CGMS data with FSGM and plasma glucose data.

NCT06471517,"Neuropathy refers to a condition that results from damage to the peripheral nerves.The most common cause of it is diabetes mellitus, metabolic disorder that affects more than 422 million individuals worldwide, putting a huge strain on the healthcare system and up to 50% of these individuals will develop neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is characterized by sensory nerve abnormalities such as an impaired sense of touch. Sensory loss in feet can lead to functional deficits during gait, low balance, and increased risk of falls and is considered the strongest risk factor for diabetic foot ulceration. Moreover, these patients usually also suffer from neuropathic pain, which is believed to be associated with aberrant sensory input.

With this in mind, the study aims to understand the effects of restoring sensation lost to neuropathy using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Additionally, the investigators aim to understand if electrical stimulation of the damaged nerves can reduce health consequences such as chronic pain.

To achieve this, the investigators have developed a wearable sensory restoration system that can restore lost sensation with non-invasive, precisely controlled electrical stimulation through electrodes integrated into the sock garment. A system is composed of a system controller that communicates via Bluetooth with force-sensitive insoles placed in the shoes and neurostimulators directly connected to electrode array socks. Based on the insole recordings the stimulation parameters are defined in real-time, making it a closed-loop system for restoring somatotopic sensory feedback.",13.766666666666667

NCT06473896,"Analgesia is one of the pillars of anesthesia. For many years, opiates were the basic ingredient in pain relief. The effectiveness of these substances in pain relief caused them to be overused which resulted in a global epidemic of addiction, morbidity and mortality due to the overuse of these drugs. Some of the options for realizing a reduction in the use of opiates include the use of drugs with a more predictable pharmacological profile and a short half-life, such as Remifentanil. This opiate is stronger than Morphine and its half-life remains within a few minutes, without accumulation even after prolonged infusion. Therefore, it seems that the use of remifentanil is ideal, especially for prolonged anesthesia.

One of the severe complications following treatment with Remifentanil is the appearance of increased sensitivity to pain \[hyperalgesia\] which results from a central sensitivity to pain and is expressed by stimulation of sensory receptors for pain in the nervous system (nociceptive sensitization). In order to alleviate the feeling of pain following the increased sensitivity to pain after treatment with opiates, as well as with Remifentanil, complementary treatments, such as Ketalar and dexmedetomidine, were offered. This study will compare the ability of Ketalar or Dexmedetomidine in alleviating increased sensitivity to pain after treatment with Remifentanil in patients who are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",24.73333333333333

NCT06475040,"Anxiety-related disorders represent the most common class of mental-health disorders and are associated with high rates of non-response and relapse to current treatments. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been shown to reduce anxiety comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, anxiety-specific targets have received insufficient attention.

An anxiety specific transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) target was recently derived via causal network mapping and was shown to reduce anxiety versus depression symptoms to a greater extent than the conventional dlPFC target in an MDD sample with comorbid anxiety. While potentially promising, this target has yet to be trialed in an anxiety-related disorder sample.

NCT06473116,"Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the leading cause of death in industrialized countries. During OHCA, the patient will present with either a non-shockable or a shockable rhythm. A shockable rhythm is treated by defibrillation, which means delivering an electrical shock through the heart to reestablish normal cardiac electric activity. If a shockable rhythm is defibrillated early, chances of survival can exceed 50%. However, if the shockable rhythm remains untreated, it will deteriorate into a non-shockable rhythm with dismal survival rates of 1-5%. Epinephrine increases the chance of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), however, there is increasing evidence that use of epinephrine is associated with severe neurological impairment in survivors. Isoprenaline is a pro-arrhythmic drug used to treat bradycardia. The drug has structural resemblance to epinephrine, however, it has no effect on alfa-adrenoceptors in the cerebral bloodflow and only stimulates beta-adrenoceptors. These pro-arrhythmic properties may induce cardiac electrical activity during OHCA with a non-shockable rhythm, converting it to a shockable rhythm treatable by defibrillation, while preserving microcirculatory cerebral blood flow.

Hypothesis: Injection of isoprenaline in bystander witnessed OHCAs with asystole increases the chance of ROSC at hospital arrival compared with the injection of epinephrine.

Population: According to the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry, the annual incidence of OHCAs in the Region of Southern Denmark is about 1200, half of which are bystander witnessed. In the recent 2022 report, the incidence of non-shockable first rhythm among these was 1,044 out of 1,233 patients (85%), of which about 9 out of 10 had asystole. Therefore, an annual number of 450 bystander witnessed OHCAs with non-shockable rhythm could be eligible for study entry, however, despite eligibility, previous study have found that about 20-25% of patients are not enrolled in similar OHCA trials, and the expected annual number of enrollments will therefore be 360 OHCAs.

Settings: The study will take place in the Region of Southern Denmark. The Region has 42 EMS ambulance stations and 6 physician-manned vehicles with a median response time of about 8 minutes. The EMS ambulance has an emergency medical technician (EMT) and an EMT assistant, trained in analysing shockable/non-shockable rhythms and administering intravenous drugs according to the advanced life support algorithm.

Intervention: On EMS arrival, OHCA patients will be randomly assigned to receive an intravenous injection of isoprenaline or to receive an intravenous injection of adrenaline in a 1:1 ratio.

Study design: A randomized-controlled trial.

Main outcome: Main outcome is ROSC at hospital arrival. Secondary outcomes are conversion from non-shockable to shockable rhythm, 30-day survival with good neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category Scale of 1 or 2).

Power analysis: Thirty-day survival among OHCAs with non-shockable rhythm is reported at 1-5%. In a Danish study, the conversion of a non-shockable rhythm to a shockable rhythm increased the rate of ROSC at hospital arrival to 14.5% compared with 8.4% for sustained non-shockable rhythms. Thirty-day survival in the two groups were 4.2% versus 1.2%, respectively. According to this study, about 1 in 8 non-shockable rhythms converted to a shockable rhythm. Presuming that isoprenaline injection may double the conversion to shockable rhythm to 1 in 4 non-shockable rhythms, this would increased chance of ROSC at hospital arrival to approximately 13%. Therefore, assuming a conservative difference estimate of about 5% (estimate of 13% in the intervention group and 8% in the control group), this study will require a total sample size of 1178 patients with 589 OHCAs in each group (power value of 0.80 and significance level of 0.05) to evaluate the hypothesis.

NCT06473454,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); It is one of the most frequently diagnosed gastrointestinal diseases, defined by the presence of altered bowel habits, abdominal pain, and discomfort in the absence of another causative disease. The research will be planned on 72 individuals between the ages of 18-65 who were diagnosed with IBS at Istanbul Medipol University Ã‡amlÄ±ca SUAM Gastroenterology Polyclinic. Patients will be divided into 3 groups; High-intensity interval training and a disease-specific nutrition program for the first group, and a disease-specific nutrition program for the second group; Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT) and a disease-specific nutrition program will be given, while the control group will be given only a disease-specific nutrition program. Evaluations will be made immediately before and after treatment. The first experimental group will be asked to walk with high-intensity interval training, which the investigators plan for 30 minutes, 4 days a week for 8 weeks. TBFT will be applied to the second experimental group every day of the week. The application will be done face to face one day a week, and the patient will be asked to do it himself on the other days, and the sessions will last approximately 30 minutes. In addition, all patients will be asked to follow the nutrition program determined by the dietician.

NCT06480539,"Due to the increase in life expectancy in the developing world, the number of elderly patients undergoing (major) surgery is expected to increase in the coming years. These elderly patients, even healthy older adults, have a reduced physiologic reserve such that organ systems may be compromised during and after surgical stress, placing them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality after surgery.

A common concern after surgery is sleep impairment. Patients often develop significant sleep disturbances after major surgery and particular elderly patients are more prone to develop sleep disturbances when compared to younger patients. Sleep plays an essential role in the homeostasis of multiple organ systems and cognitive function. A good night sleep is deemed essential for a good functional recovery. Taking this into account, it seems logical that postoperative sleep disturbances could be a contributing factor to postoperative fatigue, which is reported by patients as one of the most distressing symptoms after surgery and is thought to be the chief contributor to delayed recovery after surgery.

The endocrinological surgical response probably plays an essential role in postoperative sleep disturbances experienced by surgical patients by causing (neuro)inflammation. Keeping this in mind, dexmedetomidine might be an interesting pharmacological intervention since it has the ability to attenuate several factors that contribute to postoperative sleep disturbances including the endocrinological surgical stress response. However, whether the nocturnal administration of dexmedetomidine translates into improved postoperative sleep quality after elective major surgery, subsequently reduced postoperative fatigue and muscle weakness, and improved enhanced recovery after surgery by improving sleep, is currently unknown.

Therefore, the main objective of this prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of nocturnal dexmedetomidine on early postoperative outcomes, i.e. quality of recovery, in elderly patients (60 years or older) undergoing major surgery.",17.1

NCT06472336,"This clinical tiral focuses on comparing treatment options for patients with an acute ischemic stroke, which is a significant cause of death and disability worldwide. Currently, endovascular treatment (EVT) is the gold standard for the removal of large blood clots in the brain arteries (large vessel occlusion, LVO), but sometimes it fails to reopen blocked blood vessels, especially when caused by an underlying intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAD). When restoring blood flow fails, patients' outcomes are much worse, with more than 70% experiencing severe disability or death.

One potential solution for these cases is intracranial stenting, where a stent is permanently implanted in the affected blood vessel to restore blood flow to the brain. This approach has shown promise in other conditions like myocardial infarction. However, there is an ongoing debate whether the benefits are offset by possibly higher bleeding risk, and current guidelines don't provide clear recommendations on the use of intracranial stenting.

Therefore, this study aims to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of early intracranial stenting versus continued conventional EVT (stent-retriever or aspiration based) in LVO stroke patients who haven't responded to conventional EVT due to ICAD.

The results of this clinical trial will offer high quality clinical evidence to determine whether intracranial stenting provides benefits over conventional EVT for LVO stroke patients experiencing recanalisation failure due to ICAD.",36.5

NCT06471465,"Brain metastases (BM) are increasingly common in cancer patients; between 10% and 50% (1) will develop BM resulting in potentially disabling symptoms, degrading quality of life and impacting overall survival. The main local treatment options include surgery, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy in stereotactic condition (SRS) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Over the past decade, SRS has become the most frequently administered focal treatment(2). SRS delivers a single or multi-fraction ""ablative"" dose as the sole treatment for BM with an overall survival (OS) benefit in patients with single BM (HR = 0.76; CI95%: 0.66 - 0.88)(3) or postoperatively decreasing the risk of recurrence (HR = 0.46; CI95%: 0.24 - 0.88)(4). SRS compared to neurosurgery, has the ability to treat inoperable sites, multiple lesions, and has the advantage of being less invasive. WBRT is now limited to certain patients with multiple BMs and not eligible for SRS. SRS is often preferred to WBRT because of a lower rate of neurocognitive toxicities at 12 months (difference, -34.4%; CI95%: -74.4% to 5.5%; P = .04) for patients with 5 to 10 BMs. Local control at 1 year is high in the order of 90%, and SRS is generally considered a cost-effective treatment.

However, after SRS there can be late side effects, that can start 3 months to several years after irradiation, the most common is cerebral radio necrosis (RN) in 10% of treated patients. The pathophysiology is poorly understood and includes vascular injury, immune-mediated mechanisms and direct neuronal effects. Vascular injury leads to increased permeability after radiotherapy resulting in vasogenic oedema and ischemia, induce hypoxia and an increase in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1Î±) then upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which exacerbates the oedema by increasing vascular permeability which creates a vicious cycle and RN, hence the importance of inhibiting VEGF(5).

RN may remain as radiological changes (CTCAE v5 grade I toxicity approximately 50%)(6) to be monitored or be symptomatic (grade II-IV) and requiring treatment. Symptoms are usually manifested by focal neurological signs and symptoms related to cerebral oedema. Corticosteroids are the only standard of care before surgery, which is performed when possible. The problem is that high-dose, long-term corticosteroids have multiple side effects and some patients with RN may remain symptomatic despite corticosteroid administration (cortico-resistance) or relapse while decreasing the corticosteroid dose (cortico-dependence) and no standard treatment is available. Only one small (14 patients) randomized double-blind study compared bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks versus placebo in RN after irradiation. All 7 patients in the bevacizumab arm had a decrease in FLAIR oedema volume with clinical improvement in contrast to the placebo arm where everything worsened(7).

Thus, the anti-VEGF, bevacizumab, is an option but needs to be validated in a phase 3 randomized trial.

This randomized phase III trial aims to determine whether the impact of adding bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy results in greater symptomatic improvement than corticosteroid therapy alone in patients with symptomatic RN. RN will be defined by a multimodal imaging approach combining brain MRI and nuclear medicine imaging (18F-FDOPA PET or dual phase 18F-FDG PET on CT or MRI). The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy, compared to corticosteroid therapy plus placebo, results in greater efficacy at 3 months on decrease in corticosteroids and in neurological symptoms associated with radionecrosis (RN). Secondary endpoints were toxicities, quality of life, PROs (Patient Reported Outcomes) and Clinician Reported Outcomes (CRO), imaging changes at 3 months, total weaning of corticosteroids and response duration. An ancillary study will evaluate the correlation between the initial nuclear medicine imaging parameters and the response to treatment as well as the evolution of biological parameters under bevacizumab.",39.53333333333333

NCT06471920,"Chronic low back pain (LBP) imposes tremendous burden on affected individuals, healthcare systems, and society. LBP has been identified as the most common cause of disability globally and in the United States (US). LBP is also the largest driver of US healthcare spending ($135 billion in 2016) and the most common diagnoses associated with opioid prescription and consumption. For patients with chronic LBP, physical therapy has been shown to be a cost-effective method for improving pain and disability. In addition, physical therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of advanced imaging, injections, surgery, and opioid use in patients with chronic LBP.

Despite available evidence in support, only 7-13% of patients with LBP, including those with chronic LBP, go on to receive physical therapy services, with patients reporting barriers accessing physical therapy, such as transportation, provider availability and missed work time. Access is especially limited in rural communities where there are approximately 40% fewer physical therapists available per capita compared to metropolitan regions. In addition, patients living in rural communities likely need to travel longer distances to receive physical therapy, requiring additional missed work time and transportation costs. This lack of access to physical therapy in rural communities likely contributes to the greater rates of LBP-related disability and opioid consumption that have been observed in rural communities compared to metropolitan areas. Innovative methods for improving access to physical therapy are urgently needed to address disparities in outcomes for patients with chronic LBP living in rural communities in the US. Telehealth has rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes policy changes that have allowed physical therapists to begin providing care remotely, also referred to as telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation stands to improve access to physical therapy for patients with chronic LBP living in rural communities and may serve as a means of improving outcomes of these patients.

The investigators will conduct a single-blind prospective randomized clinical trial addressing key questions to understanding the effectiveness of a risk-informed telerehabilitation to reduce opioid use and LBP-related disability and to improve physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic LBP. Additionally, the investigators will explore implementation outcomes using a mixed methods approach consisting of electronic surveys and semi-structured interviews with patients, physical therapists, practice managers, and outpatient services administration focusing on perceived quality and impact on barriers to care. The investigators will enroll 434 patients with LBP presenting to primary care clinics serving rural communities (TidalHealth, Salisbury, MD). Eligible patients will provide informed consent and be randomized to either an educational control or risk-informed telerehabilitation (physical therapy telehealth visits, or informed physical therapy telehealth visits).

NCT06474299,"To be efficient and maximize translation potential, the investigators will use the efficient Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to identify an optimal intervention to help people who use both cigarettes and ENDS quit smoking cigarettes. As such, in this randomized 2x2x2 factorial screening trial, the investigators will examine three intervention factors:

1. Pharmacotherapy (varenicline vs. nicotine patch)
2. Counseling Intensity (4 vs. 1 session)
3. Counseling Approach (Dual Focused vs. Smoking Focused).

The Dual Focused counseling approach will encourage participants to quit their ENDS use as part of their smoking cessation attempt. The Smoking Focused counseling approach will encourage participants to quit smoking but not vaping and to use their ENDS strategically to deal with urges in service of harm reduction. There is theoretical and empirical support for these pharmacologic and counseling approaches and intensities.

Participants (N=500) will be dual users of cigarettes (\>4 cigs/day for the last 6 months) and ENDS (vape weekly for at least 6 months) who are motivated to quit smoking and willing try to quit vaping, if asked to do so. Participants will be randomized to receive either varenicline or nicotine patches for 12 weeks, to receive either one or four 15-20-minute counseling sessions, and to receive counseling that is either dual focused or smoking focused. Dual Focused Cessation will focus on quitting both smoking and vaping on the target quit date (TQD). Pre-TQD, participants will be instructed to change smoking and vaping patterns (e.g., not smoking or vaping in specific places or at specific times of day). Post-TQD, participants will focus on building smoking and vaping cessation skills (e.g., coping with cravings to smoke or vape, avoiding smoking and vaping cues). Smoking Focused Cessation will focus on quitting smoking on the TQD and using ENDS as a behavioral substitute (i.e., using ENDS as a cigarette substitute). Pre-TQD, participants will be instructed to change smoking patterns (e.g., vaping rather than smoking in specific places or at specific times of day, vaping first in the morning rather than smoking) and practice smoking cessation coping strategies (e.g., substituting ENDS for cigarettes, avoiding smoking cues). Participants will be advised to quit smoking on the TQD and not worry about quitting vaping at this point. Participants will complete daily measures of smoking, vaping, and potential change mechanisms (e.g., craving, smoking reward, self-efficacy) via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 2 weeks pre-TQD and 2 weeks post-TQD. Follow-up will occur for 12 months post-TQD.

Primary Objective: Determine which pharmacologic and counseling approaches are especially effective, alone or in combination, in helping dual users quit smoking.

Secondary Objectives:

* Examine the effects of the treatments on variables that may mediate treatment effects on smoking cessation.
* Examine

  1. changes in vaping intensity and vaping cessation
  2. moderators of treatment effects (e.g., cigarette dependence, race, menthol use, ENDS characteristics), and
  3. whether continued vaping is related to cigarette lapse and relapse amongst those who have quit smoking.",46.63333333333333
