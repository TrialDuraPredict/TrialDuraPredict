Endometriosis is usually limited to the abdominal and especially the pelvic cavity, extra-abdominal lesions are rare. Within the pelvis it shows a wide variety of locations predominantly affecting the ovaries and the uterus or the peritoneum, uterine ligaments and other pelvic structures. Traditionally, there are three major phenotypes of endometriosis: Ovarian endometrioma (OMA), superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SPE), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). A lesion is considered a DIE, if it shows infiltration deeper than 5 mm into the peritoneum. The ectopic endometrial implants may induce inflammatory processes, causing scar tissue formation, adhesions, and consequently pelvic anatomy distortion.\n\nThe prospective study aims to investigate the value of advanced MRI techniques to improve the assessment of pelvic endometriosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endometriosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"MRI","description":"MRI sequences"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic Accuracy","description":"Diagnostic accuracy of different MRI sequences in comparison to ultrasound assessment and/or laparoscopy as standard of reference.","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who undergo clinically indicated MR imaging for endometriosis evaluation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Non-MRI compatible devices/implants","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Women undergoing routine MRI for endometriosis staging.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University Hospital Zurich","city":"Zurich","state":"ZH","zip":"8091","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.36667,"lon":8.54999}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000004715","term":"Endometriosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000005831","term":"Genital Diseases, Female"},{"id":"D000052776","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000005261","term":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications"},{"id":"D000091642","term":"Urogenital Diseases"},{"id":"D000091662","term":"Genital Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7877","name":"Endometriosis","asFound":"Endometriosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M8943","name":"Genital Diseases, Female","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2876","name":"Genital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2875","name":"Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M27093","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14127","name":"Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8399","name":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BXS","name":"Urinary Tract, Sexual Organs, and Pregnancy Conditions"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
