It has been approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration as a third-line therapy for NSCLC.\n\nSRT indication: SRT（Stereotactic Radiation Therapy） is a form of local radiation therapy that delivers high doses of radiation in a limited number of treatments. Within Chinese guidelines and consensus, it is clearly defined that limited intracranial metastases can be treated with SRT instead of WBRT (Whole Brain Radiotherapy), achieving comparable or even superior efficacy while better preserving neurocognitive function."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer","Brain Metastases"],"keywords":["Anlotinib","SRT","Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer","Brain Metastases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Anlotinib+SRT Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anlotinib#12mg#PO#Q3W#d1-14#","interventionNames":["Drug: Anlotinib hydrochloride"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anlotinib hydrochloride","description":"Anlotinib#12mg#PO#Q3W#d1-14# SRT#depends","armGroupLabels":["Anlotinib+SRT Group"],"otherNames":["SRT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"intracerebral Progression-Free-Surviva（iPFS）","description":"The time from the start of treatment to intracranial tumor progression or death for any reason\n\nThe time from the start of treatment to intracranial tumor progression or death for any reason\n\nThe time from the start of treatment to intracranial tumor progression or death for any reason","timeFrame":"20 months"},{"measure":"intracerebral Objective Response Rate (iORR)","description":"The proportion of patients whose intracranial tumor volume has reduced to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit","timeFrame":"20 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"intracerebral Progression-Free-Survival rate at 6 months and 1 year","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Progression-Free-Survival（PFS）","timeFrame":"20 months"},{"measure":"Objective Response Rate（ORR）","timeFrame":"20 months"},{"measure":"intracerebral Disease Control Rate（iDCR）","timeFrame":"20 months"},{"measure":"Disease Control Rate（DCR）","timeFrame":"20 months"},{"measure":"Overall Survival（OS）","timeFrame":"20 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
