The questionnaire examines 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. According to this questionnaire, a score between 0 and 100 can be obtained, where a high score is associated with a high level of function and minor pain symptoms. A score of 100 is in fact interpreted as a condition in which there are neither limitations in conducting activities of daily living nor symptoms.","timeFrame":"baseline (post surgery)"},{"measure":"Visual Analogue Scale pain","description":"It is a one-dimensional quantitative 11-point numeric pain rating scale; the scale requires the patient to select the number that best describes the intensity of his or her pain, from 0 to 10, at that specific time. 0 means no pain and 10 indicates the worst possible pain.","timeFrame":"baseline (post surgery)"},{"measure":"EuroQoL Current Health Assessment","description":"Valuable tool for measuring the quality of life of a patient.","timeFrame":"baseline (post surgery)"},{"measure":"EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale","description":"This is a visual analog scale that has a range of scores from 0 (worst imaginable health condition) to 100 (best imaginable health condition).","timeFrame":"baseline (post surgery)"},{"measure":"Tegner Score","description":"It allows the estimation of a subject's motor activity level with a score between 0 and 10, where 0 represents 'inability' and 10 represents 'participation in competitive sports, such as soccer at the national or international level.
