For this study, biopsies that show evidence of Acute Rejection (AR), Lymphocytic Bronchiolitis (LB), Organizing Pneumonia (OP) or Acute Lung Injury (ALI) are referred to as \"Qualifying Biopsies\"; patients who had evidence of one or more of these conditions on a recent biopsy are eligible for enrollment in this study. Belumosudil is an investigational drug that blocks a molecule in the body that reduces inflammation and scarring and may play a role in the development and progression of CLAD. Belumosudil is a drug approved by the FDA to treat adults and children 12 years and older with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), a condition with some similarities to CLAD.\n\nThe primary objective it to determine the efficacy of treatment with Belumosudil + maintenance immunosuppression (IS) versus placebo + maintenance IS on preventing the subsequent development of probable or definite CLAD, lung retransplant, or death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Transplant"],"keywords":["Lung Transplant","Belumosudil","CLAD","Acute Rejection","Lymphocytic Bronchiolitis","Organizing Pneumonia","Acute Lung Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":234,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Belumosudil plus maintenance IS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Eligible lung transplant recipients who experience a qualifying biopsy 90 to 410 days posttransplant will be randomized into the study. 200 mg of Belumosudil (increased to 200 mg twice daily in participants receiving concurrent strong CYP3A inducers or PPIs) + maintenance IS will be administered daily for one year from randomization.","interventionNames":["Drug: Belumosudil"]},{"label":"Placebo + maintenance IS","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Eligible lung transplant recipients who experience a qualifying biopsy 90 to 410 days posttransplant will be randomized into the study.
