Currently, there is still no specific clinical treatment for nerve damage. After acute treatments of stroke, patients' motor ability can only improve by spontaneous recovery of brain and rehabilitation treatment.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation uses a magnetic field pulse generated by a coil outside the skull to pass through the skull. It uses the principle that magnetic electricity can generate currents, which activates nearby brain areas or changing the relationship between the left and right brains. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive, safe treatment.\n\nMirror therapy is an emerging rehabilitation method in recent years. As mirror therapy, therapists ask the patient to place the affected hand behind the mirror while looking at the image reflected by the unaffected upper limb. During mirror therapy, patients have to perform upper limb activities and imagine that the affected upper limb is performing the same action.\n\nAs mentioned above, transcranial magnetic stimulation and mirror therapy improve the recovery of stroke patients by two different ways. Currently, there are no studies that combine these two treatments. Therefore, our study hopes to initially explore the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation and the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with mirror therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Mirror Therapy","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":69,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"rTMS + mirror therapy + traditional OT","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient would receive treatment three time per week, including individualized rTMS, and following mirror therapy and traditional occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"rTMS + traditional OT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient would receive treatment three time per week, including individualized rTMS and following traditional occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"sham rTMS + traditional OT","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient would receive treatment three time per week, including sham rTMS and following traditional occupational therapy.","interventionNames":["Device: transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at both cerebral hemisphere","armGroupLabels":["rTMS + mirror therapy + traditional OT","rTMS + traditional OT","sham rTMS + traditional OT"],"otherNames":["mirror therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) - upper extremity","description":"FMA would be recorded for evaluate patients' motor function of hand.","timeFrame":"week 0, week 6, week 12"},{"measure":"Nine-hole peg test","description":"Nine-hole peg test would be used to measure finger dexterity.","timeFrame":"week 0, week 6, week 12"},{"measure":"Action research arm test","description":"Action research arm test would be used to assess upper extremity performance including coordination, dexterity and functioning.","timeFrame":"week 0, week 6, week 12"},{"measure":"Box and block test","description":"Box and block test would be used to assess unilateral gross manual dexterity.","timeFrame":"week 0, week 6, week 12"},{"measure":"Functional independence measurement","description":"Functional independence measurement would be recorded to assess a patient's level of disability as well as a change in patient status in response to rehabilitation or medical intervention.","timeFrame":"week 0, week 6, week 12"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* at least 1 month after stroke\n* manual muscle strength \\< 5\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* history of epilepsy\n* has other central nervous system diseases\n* has electric medication pump\n* has implant at inner ear","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jou Yu Lin","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+886-2-28264400","phoneExt":"3806","email":"trancequid@gmail.com"}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M22306","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5810","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5204","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5742","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17400","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
