This study aimed to investigate whether the 6-Minute Pegboard and Ring Test (6-MPRT), which has been validated in many respiratory disease groups in previous studies, is an endurance assessment battery that can also be used in Parkinson\\&#39;s patients. 6-MPRT, Weight Lifting Test, and 30-Second Arm Curl Test will be applied in the assessments. Assessments will be made twice on the same day by two different evaluators, 1 hour apart. After the first evaluation, the patient will be called for the second time 2 days later, and the same procedure will be repeated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease"],"keywords":["Parkinson","Validity","6-Minute Pegboard and Ring Test"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"6-MPRT Group","description":"There is 1 group in the study.
