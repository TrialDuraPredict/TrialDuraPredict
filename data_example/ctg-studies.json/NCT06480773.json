Previous HIV-KS studies demonstrated significant variability in clinical outcomes based on differences in gender or baseline KSHV DNA levels in patients with HIV-KS.\n\nPatients will receive chemotherapy according to local site treatment guidelines and standard of care. Chemotherapy regimen for two treatments that are used locally based on physician's choice namely intravenous (IV) Paclitaxel (PTX) or the combination of Bleomycin and Vincristine (BV). In addition, all histologically proven HIV-KS could be enrolled, irrespective of their prior length of combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART). This enrolment strategy will reflect a more realistic picture of HIV-KS management.\n\nThis study result could trigger treatment alteration of HIV-KS. The treatment approaches to HIV-KS can be individualized if clinically relevant subsets and novel prognostic markers are defined. In that case, newer and potentially more expensive agents can be selectively applied to those patients most likely to benefit, especially if prolonged treatment is needed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Kaposi Sarcoma","HIV-associated Kaposi Sarcoma","HIV Infections"],"keywords":["Paclitaxel","Bleomycin","Vincristine","anti- retroviral"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HIV-associated Kaposi Sarcoma","description":"Patients receive standard-of-care chemotherapy.","interventionNames":["Drug: standard of care chemotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"standard of care chemotherapy","description":"intravenous Paclitaxel or the combination of Bleomycin and Vincristine.","armGroupLabels":["HIV-associated Kaposi Sarcoma"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","description":"PFS will be defined as first chemotherapy day until disease progression.
