Our research focuses on investigating the preventive and therapeutic impact of N-acetylcysteine and zinc in managing radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis.","detailedDescription":"almost all head and neck cancer patients who to receive radiotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy suffer from oral mucositis. Oral mucositis (OM) is associated with pain, difficulty in eating, dysphagia, and the need for enteral or parenteral nutrition, increased opioid consumption or even interruptions to cancer therapy. In immunosuppressed patients, OM is associated with bacteremia, increased inpatient hospitalization duration and higher 100-day mortality.\n\nTreatments to manage cancer, such as radiotherapy, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that target neoplastic cell DNA resulting in cell damage and death. ROS from these therapies also indiscriminately target healthy non-neoplastic DNA.\n\nZinc carries out its antioxidant function in two ways: Reducing the concentration of oxidant agents and protecting structures and macromolecules suffer from oxidant agent.\n\nN-acetylcysteine is an aminothiol and precursor to glutathione (GSH), glutathione in its reduced form is the most powerful intracellular antioxidant, thereby protecting against radiation-induced free radical damage.\n\nour study is A randomized, controlled, parallel clinical trial that will be applied at Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine Center at Mansoura University Hospital to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of N-acetylcysteine and zinc on radiotherapy induced oral mucositis in Head and Neck cancer patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Radiation-Induced Mucositis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study is a randomized, controlled, interventional clinical trial conducted at Mansoura University Oncology Hospital.
