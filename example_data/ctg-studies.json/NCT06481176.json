The main questions the investigators aim to answer are:\n\nHow does long-term exercise change proteins in the blood?\n\nHow does a single exercise session change proteins in the blood?\n\nThe investigators will compare long-term exercise to no exercise to see if the changes in proteins are specific to exercise.\n\nParticipants will complete an exercise test and provide blood samples before and after the exercise test. Participants will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) in to either the exercise or no-exercise group for 12 weeks and then complete the exercise test and blood samples again at the end."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Restless Legs Syndrome"],"keywords":["Exercise","Proteomics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions that will be occurring simultaneously.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will complete a 12-week, RLS specific exercise program including strength training, cardiovascular exercise, and stretching.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: 12-Week RLS Exercise Program"]},{"label":"Non-Exercise","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants will have no intervention or interaction for 12 weeks."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"12-Week RLS Exercise Program","description":"Participants will complete 12 weeks of an evidence-based exercise program that has been used for people with RLS, designed for people with RLS, and was informed by exercise guidelines outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association, and Center for Disease Control.\n\nThe program includes three sessions per week for 12 weeks including:\n\n* cardiovascular exercise (e.g., walking/jogging, bicycling) for 30 minutes/day on at least 3 days/week at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity\n* strength training on 2 non-consecutive days/week targeting major muscle groups for approximately 30 minutes\n* Stretching all major muscle groups on three or more days per week","armGroupLabels":["Exercise"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Protein Expression Profile","description":"Participants will provide blood samples that will be used to measure proteins in the blood with an aptamer-based multiplexed platform of 11,000+ proteins.
