The SCOFF questionnaire is a simple 5-question test developed to assess the possible presence of an eating disorder. The S in SCOFF stands for \"sick\" (to vomit). The O stands for \"one stone\" of weight (i.e., 6.35 kg). The letters C, F and F stand for \"control\", \"fat\" and \"food\" respectively.
