These criteria aim to ensure homogeneity within the trial population, but may omit patients with specific characteristics, comorbidities or co-medications. Indeed, patients of advanced age, with comorbidities or brain metastases, who are frequently encountered in clinical practice, are often excluded from clinical trials. Real-life data in oncology play a vital role in assessing the efficacy of therapies and therapeutic strategies, complementing data from controlled clinical trials. They make it possible to analyze a larger population and take into account multiple variables such as patient history, co-medications and comorbidities, but also to analyze efficacy and toxicity data in populations not represented in clinical trials. The establishment of a prospective cohort including various stages and histologies will make it possible to set up a platform of available data, including a maximum of data linked to the patient, his tumor and his treatments, collected longitudinally until the patient's death (or the end of the study).\n\nIn parallel with this cohort, the project aims to set up a longitudinal plasmatheque (from diagnosis to death, or at the end of the study), as well as a tumorotheque (samples systematically stored as part of care by the CHU tumorotheque, and for which patient consent allows their use in research depending on the material available) for patients with available tumor samples. This will enable the construction of ancillary projects to validate research hypotheses, for example concerning the identification of mechanisms of resistance to therapies.\n\nThe main objective is to identify factors associated, including biomarkers, with response or resistance to anti-cancer therapies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Metastatic Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Real-world cohort","Lung Cancer","Biobank"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This cohort will include 5 distinct patient populations.","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":700,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort A","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients are prospectively enrolled the day before their surgery for lung cancer, following selection based on tumor size assessed by the latest CT scan.
