Tafenoquine will be self-administered orally as 2 x 100 mg dark pink coated tablets once daily (total daily dose 200 mg) with food on Days 1, 2, 3 \\& 4 then weekly thereafter (starting on day 11) until the patient has two consecutive negative PCR tests for Babesia parasites and symptoms of babesiosis have resolved. Other standard of care treatments recommended in the 2020 IDSA Guideline on Diagnosis and Management of Babesiosis should also be included in the treatment regimen."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Persistent Babesiosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"EXPANDED_ACCESS","expandedAccessTypes":{"individual":true}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tafenoquine","description":"Tafenoquine will be self-administered orally as 2 x 100 mg dark pink coated tablets once daily (total daily dose 200 mg) with food on Days 1, 2, 3 \\& 4 then weekly thereafter (starting on day 11) until the patient has two consecutive negative PCR tests for Babesia parasites and symptoms of babesiosis have resolved."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or female, aged â‰¥ 18 years\n* Laboratory confirmed infection with B. microti and exhibiting clinical symptoms of babesiosis\n* Able and willing to give written informed consent\n* Able to take ARAKODA according to Prescribing Information\n* If female willing to take birth control for 90 days\n* Have risk factors for relapsing disease\n* Azithromycin, atovaquone, and/or clindamycin administered in the last 12 months to treat babesiosis, and, in the opinion of the investigator, high likelihood that current infection represents a relapse or continuation of disease\n* Willing to initiate or continue a standard of care antimicrobial regimen\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have any of the contraindications for ARAKODA\n* Current or planned treatment with quinine while participating in the study\n* Any concomitant significant illness unrelated to babesiosis\n* Taking any excluded concomitant medication\n* The patient is unable to tolerate medication by the oral route","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Katrina Riggs","role":"CONTACT","phone":"3017585522","email":"kriggs@fasttrackresearch.com"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001404","term":"Babesiosis"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000011529","term":"Protozoan Infections, Animal"},{"id":"D000010273","term":"Parasitic Diseases, Animal"},{"id":"D000010272","term":"Parasitic Diseases"},{"id":"D000007239","term":"Infections"},{"id":"D000011528","term":"Protozoan Infections"},{"id":"D000017282","term":"Tick-Borne Diseases"},{"id":"D000079426","term":"Vector Borne Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4702","name":"Babesiosis","asFound":"Babesiosis","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10283","name":"Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M6368","name":"Communicable Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M14388","name":"Protozoan Infections","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M13185","name":"Parasitic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19577","name":"Tick-Borne Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M2054","name":"Vector Borne Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T642","name":"Babesiosis","asFound":"Babesiosis","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"C000055852","term":"Tafenoquine"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000000962","term":"Antimalarials"},{"id":"D000000981","term":"Antiprotozoal Agents"},{"id":"D000000977","term":"Antiparasitic Agents"},{"id":"D000000890","term":"Anti-Infective Agents"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M350071","name":"Tafenoquine","asFound":"Grading","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M4280","name":"Antimalarials","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4298","name":"Antiprotozoal Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4294","name":"Antiparasitic Agents","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4214","name":"Anti-Infective Agents","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Infe","name":"Anti-Infective Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
