Thus, Gattinoni in 2016 introduced the concept of mechanical power (MP) as the power exerted by the ventilator to the entire respiratory system in one minute during mechanical ventilation.\n\nTherefore, MP is a new concept in mechanical ventilation that is being increasingly recognized and studied in the field of critical care medicine. MP consists of three parts :the energy delivered just once when PEEP is applied, the energy applied to overcome airway resistance and finally, the elastic energy delivered at each tidal breath.\n\nNevertheless, shortcomings also exist in the assessment and quantification of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and the degree of lung injury by MP. For example, the energy consumed by the airflow to overcome airway resistance is difficult to link with the alveolar damage, and the energy carried by the airflow itself does not necessarily lead to ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Airway resistance and peak airway pressure are not significantly associated with VILI, as highlighted by classic lung protective ventilation strategies.\n\nThe combined effect of plateau pressure, driving pressure, tidal volume, and changes in lung compliance are the parameters for the prevention of VILI. Among the components of MP, the most closely related to ARDS lung injury might be elastic power (i.e., the power to overcome the elastic resistance of the respiratory system). Elastic energy refers to the energy exerted by the ventilator to overcome the elastic resistance of the respiratory system with a single ventilation and elastic power (EP) is the power exerted by the ventilator to overcome the elastic resistance of the respiratory system in one minute. The EP is comprised of two elements: the energy required to surpass the baseline stretch of the fibers and the energy necessary to overcome the elasticity of the respiratory system with every delivery of tidal volume."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"mild to moderate ARDS","description":"100 =\\< PO2/FiO2 ratio \\< 300","interventionNames":["Other: calculation of the elastic power of the lung in case of the ARDS and corolating with the severity index of Berline definition of ARDS in respect to mortality and severity"]},{"label":"severe ARDS","description":"100 \\< PO2/FiO2 ratio","interventionNames":["Other: calculation of the elastic power of the lung in case of the ARDS and corolating with the severity index of Berline definition of ARDS in respect to mortality and severity"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"calculation of the elastic power of the lung in case of the ARDS and corolating with the severity index of Berline definition of ARDS in respect to mortality and severity","description":"calculation of variables of the elastic power of the lung from the lung pressures on the ventilator : Elastic power = 0.098 \\* tidal volume \\* respiratory rate \\* 1/2(PEEP+Pplat)","armGroupLabels":["mild to moderate ARDS","severe ARDS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"28 day mortality","description":"- survivors are defined as patients who are discharged from ICU or survive beyond 28 days","timeFrame":"28 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"elastic power normalized to compliance","description":"investigators will compare the results of the elastic power and the elastic power normalized to compliance with the current criteria of Berlin definition of the severity of ARDS depending on the PO2/FiO2 ratio and the expected mortality to determine which is more accurate in prediction of severity and mortality.
