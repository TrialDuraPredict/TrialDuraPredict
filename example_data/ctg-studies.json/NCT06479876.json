While steps to increase utilization of CBCR are important, many individuals will still not participate for a variety of reasons. This pilot randomized controlled trial is evaluating a home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) intervention delivered using a custom app and digital tools in patients with heart failure. After a brief roll-in period, participants are randomized to one of two groups: (1) control or (2) HBCR mobile health intervention. The intervention targets key health behaviors and includes traditional cardiac rehabilitation components. The study will assess the effect of the intervention on physical activity, quality of life, clinical events, and other outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction","Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction","Cardiovascular Diseases"],"keywords":["cardiac rehabilitation, physical activity, functional capacity, quality of life, outcomes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants randomized 1:1 to 2 groups.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Assessments performed at baseline visit and final (12-week visit) will be performed by a study team member unaware of randomization group.
