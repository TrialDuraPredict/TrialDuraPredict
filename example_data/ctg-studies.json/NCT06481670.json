Optimizing fluid therapy in the peri-operative setting has been proven to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications and length of hospital stay. Based on practice guidelines under the American Society of Anesthesiologists, pre-operative hydration with complex carbohydrate drinks is safe and should be encouraged as it helps with improving metabolism to an anabolic state, decreases insulin resistance, reduces anxiety, and reduces PONV. While pre-operative carbohydrate (CHO) fluids have already been studied and adopted by other surgical specialities (Vascular, General Surgery, Orthopaedics, etc.), this has not yet been studied in oral and maxillofacial surgery, especially at Boston Medical Center (BMC).\n\nDuring surgery, each participant will undergo our current Enhanced Recovery After Surgery \"ERAS\" protocol, which includes general anesthesia using inhalational gas, judicious IV fluids, intra-operative steroid and ondansetron (anti-emetic), use of 0.5% bupivacaine local anesthesia per quadrant at surgery end time, use of a throat pack, and orogastric/nasogastric (OG/NG) tube suctioning prior to extubation to minimize ingestion of blood. Pain and anxiety medications prior to and during surgery include 2 mg midazolam, fentanyl per anesthesia, toradol, and dexmedetomidine. Having this protocol will help minimize confounding variables that could affect the primary outcome-- incidence and severity of PONV.\n\nThe objectives for this research are:\n\n* To evaluate if pre-operative clear CHO help reduce incidence and intensity of PONV.\n* To assess if pre-operative clear carbohydrate fluids affect length of hospital stay\n* To determine if pre-operative CHO reduce patient's pre-/post-operative anxiety\n* To compare the amount/number of opioids and anti-emetics needed post-operatively between the two groups\n* To compare ability for patients to return to PO hydration via the amount of fluid ingestion (mL) vs. if they need IV fluids due to decreased PO intake/inability to tolerate PO fluids\n* To evaluate if patient Apfel score is also a strong indicator for incidence/severity of PONV"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nausea, Postoperative","Vomiting, Postoperative"],"keywords":["Orthognathic surgery","Carbohydrate rich drinks","Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Preoperative carbohydrate drink","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized into this group will receive a carbohydrate drink before surgery.","interventionNames":["Other: Carbohydrate drink"]},{"label":"Preoperative fasting","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Participants randomized into this group will be fasting/nothing by mouth (NPO) before surgery."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Carbohydrate drink","description":"The \\>50 g carbohydrate drink will be consumed up to 2 hours prior to surgery.","armGroupLabels":["Preoperative carbohydrate drink"],"otherNames":["Apple juice"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Intensity of post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)","description":"The post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) intensity scale will be used to assess this outcome.
