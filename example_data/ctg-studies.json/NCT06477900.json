goal of this interventionnal study is to demonstrate that sending SMS messages with advice on physical activity or nutrition, in addition to a program of hygienic-dietary management, significantly increases weight loss in subjects with prediabetes in La Réunion.\n\nIndeed, type 2 diabetes is a priority health problem on Reunion Island: 10% of the population are treated for type 2 diabetes, twice as many as in France.\n\nInternational studies have demonstrated the value of modifying dietary and physical activity habits to reduce the risk of transition to diabetes in patients with prediabetes Against this backdrop, a Regional Nutrition Diabetes Program (PRND) 2020-2023 was launched by Réunion's Regional Health Agency (ARS) in 2020.\n\nStudies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of using SMS to encourage and support weight loss interventions.\n\nSo, the main question it aims to answer are:\n\n• Does the addition of 72 SMS of physical activity and nutriton advice, to the \"FindRisc Péi-CPTS\" program, significantly increase weight loss by 3% after 6 months of starting the program.\n\nFindRiscPei-CPTS program includes sports sessions, dietary consultations and therapeutic education.\n\nThe 300 participants will be randomized into two arms\n\n* 150 participants will take part in the FindRiscPei-CPTS program + receive SMS messages\n* 150 participants will only take part in the FindRiscPei-CPTS program (no SMS)\n\nAll participants will follow procedures below:\n\n* Inclusion: assessment of weight and waist circumference, Lifestyle Questionnaire and Socio-Efficacy Questionnaire.\n* Participation in Findrisk program for 3 to 9 months (+ SMS for experimental group)\n* 3 follow-up visits: 3 months, 6 months and 9 months after starting the program: weight and waist measurement, self-efficacy questionnaire.","detailedDescription":"The outcomes of this study are :\n\n* A better understanding of the effectiveness of the SMS intervention in the context of health and diet prevention programs for patients with pre-diabetes.\n* More precise recommendations for healthcare professionals and decision-makers on the use of SMS intervention in this context.\n* Improved health outcomes for prediabetes patients through the identification of effective diabetes prevention strategies.\n* A positive impact on healthcare costs by reducing the progression from prediabetes to diabetes, and by reducing the use of costly healthcare associated with diabetes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["PreDiabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SMS
