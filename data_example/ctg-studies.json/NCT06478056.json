Its overall 5-year survival for all stages combined is estimated at 7-8%.\n\nSurgery is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA), although only 10-20% of patients present with resectable disease. The oncological results of surgery alone are disappointing (median overall survival (OS) of 15-20 months and 5-year OS of 8-15%), due to the high frequency of recurrence. For this reason, surgery must be integrated into a comprehensive treatment sequence, also known as multimodal therapy.\n\nSignificant progress has been observed over the past 5 years, with a marked increase in median OS in recent clinical trials, and an intensification of perioperative chemotherapy (CT) protocols.\n\nLiquid biopsy and circulating biomarkers show promise for improving the multidisciplinary approach to treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the most extensively studied marker in blood liquid biopsies and can provide insight into the molecular profile and individual characteristics of the tumor. This could pave the way for the identification of new therapeutic targets and markers of tumor response to complement diagnosis and provide improved stratified treatment. Similarly, the measurement of tcDNA in peritoneal fluid could provide a better understanding of individual tumour characteristics and the risk of peritoneal metastasis.\n\nIt is important to assess whether portal venous ctDNA is likely to provide distinct information from peripheral venous ctDNA; if the two ctDNAs are highly correlated, then it seems unlikely that one can provide complementary information to the other.\n\nIn addition, our work would evaluate the prognostic impact of the detection of circulating tumor DNA in portal venous blood collected intraoperatively, as well as its detection in peritoneal fluid."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pancreatic Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Surgery","type":"OTHER","description":"patients operated on for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the digestive surgery department of Rouen University Hospital","interventionNames":["Procedure: pancreatectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"pancreatectomy","description":"patients operated on for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the digestive surgery department of Rouen University Hospital","armGroupLabels":["Surgery"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"level of ctDNA","description":"the level of ctDNA measured in peripheral venous and portal blood before and after mobilization of the specimen during surgery","timeFrame":"Surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"level of ctDNA","description":"ctDNA levels measured in peripheral venous and portal blood before and after mobilization of the specimen during surgery","timeFrame":"surgery"},{"measure":"peritoneal ctDNA level","description":"ctDNA levels measured in peritoneal fluid during surgery.","timeFrame":"surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Patient with operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (resectable or boderline with or without neoadjuvant therapy) with histological evidence or indirect diagnostic criteria (CA 19-9 Significant (≥ 200 U/ml), pancreatic hypodense lesion without differential diagnosis)\n* Biological criteria: Neutrophils \\> 1,500 cmm, platelet count \\> 100,000 cmm, creatinine clearance (Cockroft and Gault equation) \\> 60 ml/min, hemoglobin \\> 10 g/dl.\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n* Patient has read and understood the information letter and signed the non-opposition/consent form.\n* For an adult unable to give consent: Representative of the adult who has read and understood the information letter and signed the consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Other active cancer or haematological malignancy\n* Uncontrolled congestive heart failure - untreated angina pectoris;
