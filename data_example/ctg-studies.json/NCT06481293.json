Smoker patients with dry sockets were enrolled randomly into two different groups. Group 1 received dual wavelength laser diode therapy, three times per week. While group 2 received only a topical application of alveogl. The treatment lasted for two consecutive weeks. The treatment efficiency was evaluated by measuring the volume of the socket using the syringe method. The pain level was measured by the visual analog scale."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Alveolar Osteitis"],"keywords":["Diode laser","Dry socket"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The study included two groups.
