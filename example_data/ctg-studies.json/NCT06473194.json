These benefits included many items, e.g. reducing post-operative pain, cosmetic the result was improved, and the patient also had more satisfaction for the patient and reduced hospital stay. This surgery involved insufflation of gas into the peritoneal cavity, producing pneumoperitoneum, and causing an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. The raised intraabdominal pressure of the pneumoperitoneum, the patient's position alteration, and the absorption of carbon dioxide into the abdomen have a direct effect on causing a change in physiology, especially in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. These effects, as well as a direct effect of gas insufflation, may have significant effects on the patient especially if the patient has a comorbidity or is elderly.","detailedDescription":"The objective of this study was to assess the technique used in laparoscopic surgery and their associated complications, including some hematological parameters, (these include blood pictures and liver enzymes), respiratory, (including the inspired and expired tidal volume, oxygen saturation, airway pressure, plateau pressure, and use of PEEP) cardiovascular system (including the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, heart rate)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anesthesia Complication","Physiological Parameter"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"describe techniques of laparoscopic procedures. 2.
