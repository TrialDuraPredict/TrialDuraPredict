The Hunger VAS asks \"How hungry did you feel over the past week\" and is composed of a line with words anchored at each end describing the extremes (Not at all hungry, Extremely hungry).

The SCS consists of six subscales:\n\nself-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identified.\n\nSubscales are computed by calculating the mean of subscale item responses. A total self-compassion score can be obtained by reverse scoring the negative subscale items (self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification) and computing a grand mean of all six subscale means. Higher scores indicate greater self compassion.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 12 weeks"},{"measure":"Weight Bias","description":"The Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS-2F) has 13 items and responses are rated on a 7-point Likert scale(strongly disagree -strongly agree). Responses provide insight on the participant's internalized beliefs and feelings regarding their weight. There are two subscales: Weight-Related Distress (7 items; 7-13; Cronbach's alpha =0.910) and Weight-Related Self-Devaluation (6 items; 1-6; Cronbach's alpha =0.763). The WBIS-2F has been tested for validity in people with overweight and obesity and the two factor model demonstrated good to excellent fit with the data. Scores are calculated by taking an average of the response values. Questions 1,2,4,5, should be reverse scored before calculating the average. Higher scores indicating greater internalized weight bias.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* BMI of \\>30 or BMI of \\>27 with one or more weight related medically qualifying condition (hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease)\n* Determined eligible for Bupropion/Naltrexone or Liraglutide by WW Clinic medical provider and initiated a medication management plan\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diabetes\n* Uncontrolled hypertension\n* History of seizures\n* History of glaucoma\n* History of chronic kidney disease\n* Currently taking bupropion\n* Currently taking naltrexone\n* Current or previous history of anorexia or bulimia nervosa\n* Engagement with vomiting or laxative use within the last 28 days with the aim of controlling their shape or weight\n* Currently taking opioids\n* Previous surgical obesity treatment\n* Use of other anti-obesity medication in last 90 days or a GLP1 in the last 180 days\n* Lost weight \\>11 lbs in the last 90 days\n* Pregnant, breastfeeding, intends to become pregnant, of child-bearing potential and not using a highly effective contraceptive method\n* Any other reason rendering a participant unsuitable for trial participation, as determined by a clinician or study investigator","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Rebecca A Jones, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(800) 651-6000","email":"rebecca.jones@ww.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Michelle Cardel, PhD, RD","affiliation":"WW International Inc","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"WW International, Inc","status":"RECRUITING","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10010","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Rebecca A Jones, PhD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009765","term":"Obesity"},{"id":"D000050177","term":"Overweight"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000044343","term":"Overnutrition"},{"id":"D000009748","term":"Nutrition Disorders"},{"id":"D000001835","term":"Body Weight"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M12701","name":"Obesity","asFound":"Obesity","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5114","name":"Body Weight","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26186","name":"Overweight","asFound":"Overweight","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M25307","name":"Overnutrition","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12684","name":"Nutrition Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
