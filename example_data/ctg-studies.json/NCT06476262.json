The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDo mRS score, time since stroke onset, cognitive disorders, mood disorders and fatigue negatively impact occupations after mild stroke?\n\nDoes an increased prevalence of occupational gaps correlate with a diminished quality of life following mild stroke?"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Occupational Problems"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"This research has only one arm.

Two studies are published on occupational gaps. An occupational gap is defined as the gap that occurs between what an individual wants and needs to do and what he/she actually does.","timeFrame":"the OGQ was administred at the inclusion"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale","description":"The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a questionnaire widely used for detecting anxiety and depressive disorders.HADS comprises 14 items, seven of which relate to anxiety symptoms and seven to depressive symptoms. Each item is coded from 0 to 3. The scores for anxiety and depression can therefore vary from 0 to 21, depending on the presence and severity of the symptoms","timeFrame":"HADS was asministred at the inclusion"},{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment","description":"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening instrument for the detection of mild cognitive impairment. The MoCA assesses the following cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.","timeFrame":"MoCA was administred at the inclusion"},{"measure":"Stroke Impact Scale","description":"The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a stroke-specific, self-report, health status measure. It was designed to assess multidimensional stroke outcomes, including strength, hand function Activities of Daily Living / Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL), mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation.","timeFrame":"The SIS was administred at the inclusion"},{"measure":"modified Ranking Scale","description":"The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) is a single item, global outcomes rating scale for patients post-stroke. It is used to categorize level of functional independence with reference to pre-stroke activities rather than on observed performance of a specific task.","timeFrame":"The mRS was administred at the inclusion"},{"measure":"Fatigue Severity Scale","description":"The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a 9-item scale which measures the severity of fatigue and its effect on a person's activities and lifestyle in patients with a variety of disorders.","timeFrame":"The FSS was administred at the inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* over 18 years old,\n* a diagnosis of stroke confirmed by cerebral imaging,\n* an mRS score \\<3 at the post-stroke consultation,\n* informed about the study\n* not opposed to participation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* cognitive dysfunction making participation in the study impossible,\n* phasic disorders preventing comprehension of the questionnaires,\n* neurological deficits prior to the stroke, a history of psychiatric disorders\n* being under legal protection.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"The study population was selected from the active file of stroke patients undergoing post-stroke consultation at the Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Christophe T Duret, MD","affiliation":"Clinique Les Trois Soleils","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Clinique Les Trois Soleils","city":"Boissise-le-Roi","zip":"77310","country":"France","geoPoint":{"lat":48.52479,"lon":2.56971}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000020521","term":"Stroke"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002561","term":"Cerebrovascular Disorders"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D000002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M22306","name":"Stroke","asFound":"Stroke","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5810","name":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5204","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5742","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17400","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T6034","name":"Quality of Life","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]}},"hasResults":false}
