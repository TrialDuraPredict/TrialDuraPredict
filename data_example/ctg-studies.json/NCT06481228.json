The available data suggest that the advancement of immunotherapy from R/R field to the frontline setting may be an important approach to increase the depth of remission, which ultimately translates into a survival benefit. In this study, the investigators propose a treatment regimen using CAR-T cell therapy as a consolidation method for Ph+ ALL patients achieving complete remission (CR) with overembatinib, venetoclax and reduced-intensity chemotherapy, aiming to reduce the total cycles of chemotherapy and related toxicities, shorten length of hospitalization, and ultimately improve patients' survival and quality of life.","detailedDescription":"The CAR-T cells were murine-derived second-generation CD19 CAR-T with a co-stimulation domain of 4-1BB, and the infusion dose was 1×10\\^6/kg CAR+ cells in a single infusion."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Philadelphia Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Adult"],"keywords":["Ph-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","CAR-T cell","Venetoclax","olverembatinib","Newly Diagnosed"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":82,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TKI Combined With Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ph+ALL patients receiving CAR-T cells as consolidation therapy after achieving complete remission (CR) with overembatinib, venetoclax and reduced-intensity chemotherapy.","interventionNames":["Combination Product: CAR-T cells","Drug: Venetoclax","Drug: Olverembatinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"CAR-T cells","description":"CAR-T cells as consolidation therapy","armGroupLabels":["TKI Combined With Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Venetoclax","description":"BCL2 inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["TKI Combined With Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Olverembatinib","description":"TKI","armGroupLabels":["TKI Combined With Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Disease-free Survival (DFS)","description":"From CR1 to relapse, death from any cause or last follow-up","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years post-registration"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"From the date of registration to the date of death resulting from any cause.","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration"},{"measure":"Event-free survival (EFS)","description":"From the date of registration to the date of induction failure, relapse, death from any cause, or last follow-up","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration"},{"measure":"Cumulative rate of complete molecular response","description":"The cumulative rate of patients achieving complete molecular remission","timeFrame":"Up to 1 year post-registration"},{"measure":"MRD-negative complete remission rate measured by NGS tracking clonal IG/TR rearrangements","description":"No clonal IG/TR rearrangements were detected by NGS","timeFrame":"Up to 1 year post-registration"},{"measure":"Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR)","description":"Calculated with the cumulative incidence method, with death in patients who had a complete hematologic response as a competing risk.","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years post-registration"},{"measure":"The rate of adverse","description":"adverse events during the treatment","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
