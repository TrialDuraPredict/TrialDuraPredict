The incidence of falls in older adults is high, with approximately 30% of adults over the age of 65 falling at least once per year. Falls can lead to serious consequences such as fractures, hospitalization, and loss of independence. The changes in neurophysiology have also been found to decrease balance control in aging people, leading to postural instability. It is well-known that postural balance is influenced by sensory inputs, including touch, proprioception, vision, and vestibular, as well as motor output such as motor controls. Impairments in these systems contribute to postural instability and an increased risk of falling in the elderly.","detailedDescription":"The data collection will be arranged in the same order. Practice trials will be provided before the start of the data collection. The entire data collection session will take approximately 90 minutes. Data collection will be conducted for both the baseline and the 3-month follow-up.\n\nThe data collection will include:\n\n1. Demographic information such as age, sex, body height, body weight, body mass index, medical history, medical diagnosis, body composition, and the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).\n2. Neurophysiological assessments such as electromyography and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST).\n3. Functional tests such as the Timed up and go test and Chait stand test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fall"],"keywords":["Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Quantitative Sensory Testing","Falls","Elderly"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non-fallers","description":"Elderly without history of fall"},{"label":"Fallers-low risk","description":"Elderly with a history of falling 1 time within the last year."},{"label":"Fallers-moderate risk","description":"Elderly with a history of falling twice within the last year."},{"label":"Fallers-high risk","description":"Elderly with a history of falling \\>2 times within the last year."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)","description":"MoCa is a screening test used to detect mild cognitive decline and early signs of dementia.
