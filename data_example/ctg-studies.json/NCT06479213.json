The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is the REACH program feasible and acceptable to participants?\n2. What is the impact of the REACH program on fatigue?\n\nResearchers will compare the REACH peer coaching program to the REACH mobile health application to see if the REACH program works to reduce fatigue.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Use the REACH mobile health application to set weekly movement goals and log daily physical activity\n* Meet weekly with their REACH peer coach (if they have one) to talk about their movement goals and progress\n* Complete weekly symptom surveys\n* Complete study surveys when they start the program, in the middle of the program, at the end of the program, and 12 weeks after the program ends\n* Participate in an interview to provide feedback on the program"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","Fatigue"],"keywords":["Physical activity","Peer coaching","Mobile health application","Chronic disease self-management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"REACH Peer Coaching Program","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive access to the REACH mobile health application and a REACH peer coach with whom they will meet weekly during the 12 weeks of the program.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: REACH Peer Coaching Program","Behavioral: REACH Mobile Health Application"]},{"label":"REACH Mobile Health Application","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive access to the REACH mobile health application which they will use during the 12 weeks of the program.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: REACH Mobile Health Application"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"REACH Peer Coaching Program","description":"The REACH Peer Coaching Program consists of weekly coaching calls conducted over video teleconference.
