Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to improve cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairement. This trial is designed to compare the effects of rTMS versus sham intervention on postoperative neurocognitive function in patients with preoperative cognitive impairment.","detailedDescription":"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects 10-15% of the population over 65 years old. In patients for elective non-cardiac and emergency surgeries, the pooled prevalences of unrecognized cognitive impairment were 37.0% and 50.0%, respectively. Patients with preoperative cognitive impairment are at increased risk of delayed neurocognitive recovery (DNR) and postoperative neurocognitive disorder (POCD). Therefore, perioperative neurocognitive protection is particularly important for patients with preoperative cognitive impairment.\n\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a neural modulation technique. By acting on the brain and altering the membrane potential of cortical neurons, the generated pulsed magnetic fields affect neural metabolism and electrical activity and trigger a series of physiological and biochemical reactions. It was found that high frequency (\\>5 Hz) rTMS increases cortical excitability, whereas low frequency (\\<1Hz) rTMS reduces corticol excitability. The mechanism by which rTMS regulates brain function is generally believed to be related to the long-term enhancement and long-term inhibition of synaptic transmission function.\n\nThe left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an important target of rTMS intervention for improving cognitive function. A meta-analysis showed that high-frequency rTMS on the DLPFC and low-frequency rTMS on the right medial prefrontal cortex improved memory function; high frequency rTMS on the right inferior frontal gyrus enhanced executive ability in non-surgical patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. Another meta-analysis showed that high-frequency rTMS on DLPFC is an effective therapeutic option for improving cognitive function in Alzheimer patients.\n\nThis trial is designed to compare the effects of rTMS versus sham intervention on postoperative neurocognitive function in patients with preoperative cognitive impairment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Older Patients","Cognitive Impairment","Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery","Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorder"],"keywords":["Older patients","Cognitive impairment","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation","Delayed neurocognitive recovery","Postoperative neurocognitive disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":568,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for a 5-day period (1 day before surgery and 4 consecutive days after surgery).
