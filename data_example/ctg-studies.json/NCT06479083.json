The central element of the new form of care is the implementation of a tele medical evaluation and coordination function, which controls individualized treatment processes within the network. The individualized evaluation and coordination of treatment paths is carried out within the already existing Parkinson's network RheinMain+ by a non-physician medical specialist (APN) specially trained for the indication Parkinson's disease. In-depth assessments of the individual disease situation of the patients will take place. Based on these assessments, an evidence-based and patient-centered treatment and care plan is developed. The treatment plans are monitored, controlled and evaluated by the APNs using audiovisual or tele medical communication. In addition, APNs are empowered to initiate treatment interventions necessary to implement clinical guidelines and standards, and to take charge of these interventions as part of delegation processes. The APNs ensure that patients are cared for in accordance with needs and guidelines in all areas of care. To this end, they offer, among other things, training in the handling of patients with Parkinson's disease for other professional groups involved in the treatment process and not only have the patients in mind, but also include relatives and the supporting team."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease"],"keywords":["Parkinson Disease, Advanced Practice Nurse, Telemedical, Interdisciplinary, cross-sector care networks and pathways."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Study design: mixed-method approach; randomized study design.
