Individuals will be evaluated with the Sociodemographic Data Form and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) before the application.\n\nBefore and after the application, individuals were assessed for TMJ and Neck pain with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), TMJ symptom severity with the Fonseka questionnaire, pain threshold with the Analog Algometer, TMJ range of motion with the digital caliper, jaw functions with the Jaw Function Limitation Scale (JFLS-20) and cervical posture, muscle performance and mobility will be evaluated with craniovertebral angle, craniocervical flexion test and goniometer."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Temporomandibular Joint Disorders"],"keywords":["Temporomandibular Joint Disorders"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study was planned as a randomized controlled trial.

Measurements will be made from the bilateral side with the algometer held perpendicular to the skin, the most bulging part of the masseter muscle, 2 cm behind the anterior border of the temporalis muscle (on the line between the upper orbital edge and the upper point of the ear) and lateral to the temporomandibular joint. Measurements will also be taken from the trapezius muscle for the neck. For this, measurements will be taken at the midpoint of the C7 spinous process and the acromion.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"TMJ Range of Motion","description":"TMJ range of motion (maximum mouth opening, lateral deviation and protrusion) will be measured with a digital caliper.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 8 weeks"},{"measure":"The Fonseka Questionnaire","description":"It assesses TMJ disorder and its severity. The questionnaire includes three options: \"yes\" (10 points), \"sometimes\" (5 points) and \"no\" (0 points).
