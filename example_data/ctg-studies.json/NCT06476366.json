These drugs have been used successfully as steroid-sparing alternatives in a variety of related dermatoses and this trial may help in paving the path towards the ubiquitous use of these cost-effective and relatively safer drugs in CAD patients of our population. The researchers will try to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Is methotrexate safe and efficacious in treating CAD?\n2. Is there a difference in efficacy of methotrexate and azathioprine in the treatment of this disease?\n\nAfter the enrollment of patients and taking consent, participants will be divided in two treatment groups via lottery method. Group A will be administered oral methotrexate 10mg/week after a test dose while group B will be administered tablet azathioprine at a dose of 0.3mg/kg daily after. Both group of patients will be advised regarding strict sun protection measures (sunblock, hats, sunglasses etc.). The baseline investigations for both groups will include complete blood picture (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and urine analysis while thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) levels will be assessed specifically for group B patients. The patients will be followed up at week 4, 12 and 24. CBC, RFTs and LFTs will be done at each follow-up and EASI score will be calculated,"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Actinic Dermatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two arms of the study will be as follows:\n\nGroup A: Methotrexate 10mg/week Group B: Azathioprine 0.3mg/kg daily","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Methotrexate arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"After the enrollment of patients and taking consent, participants will be divided in two treatment groups via lottery method.
