They will receive dual platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections, one into the rotator cuff insertion and one into the area of the tendon proximal to the insertion, in one treatment session. PRP will be prepared through a double spin technique to create two 4 cc doses for injection. Patients will evaluated at 6 months, 1 year and two years for improvement in symptoms."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rotator Cuff Tears","Rotator Cuff Tendinitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Dual injections of PRP - 4 ml injected into each location.
