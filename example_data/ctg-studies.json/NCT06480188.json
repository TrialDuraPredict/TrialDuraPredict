Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a significant therapeutic approach for medically refractory craniocervical dystonia. The commonly utilized DBS targets are the Globus Pallidus internus (GPi) and the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). Current research indicates no significant difference in efficacy between these two targets, although there are some differences in the onset time, stimulation voltage, and complications. Studies utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess brain activity differences in patients with dystonia have found that patients exhibit increased activity and enhanced plasticity across a broad range of brain regions, including the brainstem, cortex, subcortical structures, and the basal ganglia, among others. Consequently, an increasing number of studies are classifying dystonia within the spectrum of brain network disorders. This study aims to recruit patients with craniocervical dystonia who meet the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning them into two groups of 30 patients each. One group will receive stimulation targeting the STN, and the other will target the GPi. Using functional MRI, researcher will conduct a dynamic brain network analysis to explore the differences in the brain network mechanisms underlying the treatment of craniocervical dystonia patients between the STN and GPi targets.","detailedDescription":"The objectives of this study are: 1) to explore the differences of brain network mechanisms between STN and GPi targets in craniocervical dystonia; 2. To explore the effects of DBS on dysarthsia and dysphagia in patients with craniocervical dystonia and the differences in efficacy, quality of life and side effects between GPi and STN targets in the treatment of craniocervical dystonia; 3. To explore the differences in the electrophysiological signals of nuclei collected during DBS surgery and their application in programming."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dystonia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Device: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of Gpi，PINS G106R Device: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of STN，PINS G106R","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group A was the GPi-DBS stimulation group","interventionNames":["Device: deep brain stimulation"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Group B was the STN-DBS stimulation group","interventionNames":["Device: deep brain stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"deep brain stimulation","description":"Group A was the GPi-DBS stimulation group； Group B was the STN-DBS stimulation group","armGroupLabels":["Group A","Group B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data","description":"First, all participants underwent a standardized rs-fMRI scan for data collection of resting-state BOLD signals.
