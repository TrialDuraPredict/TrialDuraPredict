This pertains to individuals with locally advanced thyroid cancer who have undergone conventional therapy in the past or unresectable patients .","detailedDescription":"This research trial aims to determine the efficacy of organoid-guided targeted therapy for patients with locally advanced thyroid cancer. We will also investigate the variables affecting the effectiveness of targeted therapy for locally advanced thyroid cancer that is guided by organoids. Additionally, side effects related to the medication are also studied.\n\nThe following are the main questions that the trial seeks to address:\n\nCan patients' tumor sizes be shrunk by taking medications that were found to be sensitive by organoid screening? Can patients' survival outcomes be improved by the medications that organoid screening found as sensitive? What aspects of the medications shown to be responsive by organoid screening are impacting their clinical efficacy? Is it possible for organoid-based drugs screening to guide treatment which lower surgical risk and make cancers that are now incurable into manageable ones? To ascertain the efficacy of the screened sensitive drugs in treating locally advanced thyroid cancer, researchers will measure the tumor size before and after taking the organoid-screened sensitive targeted drugs, assess the risk of radical resection, and document the survival outcomes of enrolled patients.\n\nTo further elucidate the parameters impacting the efficacy and prognosis, prognostic analysis based on clinical and pathological data, such as pathological type, gene mutation, age, tumor size, distant metastasis, and involvement of the trachea, esophagus, or major artery, will also be conducted.\n\nThe sample size for this study was determined based on the objective response rate (ORR) observed in our preliminary pilot study, which indicated an ORR of 22%. For papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), we aimed to detect a treatment effect with a minimum ORR of 12%, consistent with results from the previous multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (DECISION). For anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we aimed to detect a treatment effect with a minimum ORR of 1%, considered the threshold for clinical efficacy.\n\nTo achieve a one-sided 95% confidence interval (α = 0.05), the Clopper-Pearson method was used to calculate the confidence interval for a proportion. This method ensured that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval would exceed the minimum ORR (12% for PTC, FTC, and PDTC; 1% for ATC and MTC).\n\nThe calculation indicated that a total of 42 samples are needed for PTC, FTC, and PDTC, while 5 samples are required for both MTC and ATC.\n\nConsidering a 10% dropout rate and an 80% success rate for organoid drug sensitivity tests, a total of 59 samples are needed for PTC, FTC, and PDTC, while 7 samples are required for both MTC and ATC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Locally Advanced Thyroid Gland Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":75,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Organoid-guided targeted therapeutic group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients who take the recommended drugs regularly based on sensitivity analysis.","interventionNames":["Drug: Anlotinib","Drug: Lenvatinib","Drug: Sorafenib","Drug: Donafenib","Drug: Everolimus","Drug: Apatinib","Drug: Dabrafenib + Trametinib","Drug: Cabozantinib","Drug: Vandetanib","Drug: Entrectinib","Drug: Pralsetinib","Drug: Larotrectinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Anlotinib","description":"8/10/12 mg qd, po.
