The researchers hypothesize that THC will attenuate behavioral and physiological responses to negative valence stimuli, including memories of aversive experiences.","detailedDescription":"The current study will use a between subject, randomized, placebo-controlled design to assess the effects of low doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on stress memories. Healthy male and female participants (N=48) will be randomly assigned to one of the three drug conditions (5 mg THC \\[n=16\\], 10 mg THC \\[n=16\\], or placebo \\[n=16\\]). Each subject will participate in 3 sessions. In the first session, they will undergo the TSST procedure. Researchers will obtain ratings of subjective distress, heart rate variability, and cortisol levels to assess response to the stressor for each individual. On the second session, one week later, participants will receive either THC or placebo and they will then be presented with TSST-related cues during a stress-memory retrieval session."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)","Stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Dextrose capsules","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"5 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Marinol (dronabinol)","interventionNames":["Drug: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5)"]},{"label":"10 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Marinol (dronabinol)","interventionNames":["Drug: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (10)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5)","description":"5 mg of THC","armGroupLabels":["5 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo - dextrose","armGroupLabels":["placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (10)","description":"10 mg of THC","armGroupLabels":["10 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in emotional responses after stress memory cues compared to control cues after delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5 mg, 10 mg) vs. placebo","description":"Using a visual analog scale participants will rate feelings of 'distress' 'arousal' and 'valence'.
