Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria will receive Compound Alverine Citrate Capsules (Lejiansu; specification: each capsule contains 60 mg of Alverine Citrate and 300 mg of Simethicone; produced by Laboratoires Mayoly Spindler, France) after signing the informed consent form. The dosage is 180 mg/day (1 capsule orally three times a day) for a treatment period of 24 weeks. Apart from the baseline period, efficacy will be evaluated at the end of the 24-week treatment period. Safety assessments will be conducted throughout the trial. The safety evaluation will be performed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 by the National Cancer Institute.\n\nStudy Population: Patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension\n\nIntervention: Compound Alverine Citrate Capsules (Lejiansu; each capsule contains 60 mg of Alverine Citrate and 300 mg of Simethicone; manufactured by the French company UCB Pharma), 180 mg/day (1 capsule orally, 3 times a day), taken continuously for 24 weeks.\n\nStudy Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Compound Alverine Citrate Capsules in treating portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.\n\nStudy Endpoints Primary Endpoints\n\n1. Safety Assessment: Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment (evaluated according to CTCAE version 5.0).\n2. Efficacy Assessment: The response rate at 24 weeks of treatment, defined as a reduction in HVPG by ≥ 10% from baseline or a reduction to below 12 mmHg.\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\n1. HVPG Changes: The absolute value and percentage change in HVPG from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment.\n2. Decompensation Events: Incidence of cirrhosis decompensation events during treatment, including esophageal/gastric variceal bleeding and re-bleeding, new or worsening ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, overt hepatic encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury/hepatorenal syndrome.\n3. 12-Week Response Rate: The treatment response rate at 12 weeks.\n4. Mortality and Transplantation: Rates of death, liver transplantation, and liver disease-related mortality during the treatment period.\n\nExploratory Endpoints\n\n1. Cardiac Function: Changes in cardiac function from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment.\n2. Liver and Spleen Stiffness: Changes in liver and spleen stiffness from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment.\n3. Esophageal Varices: Status of esophageal varices after 24 weeks of treatment.\n\nSample Size Calculation: This trial is a single-arm, exploratory clinical study, and plans to enroll 30 subjects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hypertension, Portal"],"keywords":["Portal hypertension","Alverine","Pharmacological therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Alverine Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Compound Alverine Citrate Capsules (Lejiansu;
