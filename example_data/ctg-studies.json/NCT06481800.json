The patients complain of strong, irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations deeply in the legs. Poor sleep quality affects many hemodialysis patients and can potentially predict their morbidity, mortality, quality of life and pattern of medication use. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is one way to improve physical work capacity and reduce functional limitations. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a traditional therapy in which the hands work on the tissues of the body, including tuina, acupressure, and the likes. It is beneficial to the well-being of patients both physically and mentally"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodialysis Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized controlled trial.
