Urea, S. Creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), S. Sodium, S. Potassium\n* S.troponin\n* Cpk,Cpk mb\n* lipid profile\n* Blood glucose levels at time of admission ,during hospitalization and at discharge\n* CRP\n* HbA1c\n* S.total protein, S. ALB D- 12 lead ECG E-Score and ratio calculations A- MAPH score The predictive cut-off values of MPV, total protein, age and hematocrit for high thrombus grade were determined using the Youden index. The values higher from the cut-off were considered as a score of 1 and MAPH score was calculated as the sum score of 0 or 1 by the cut-off in each ratio.(6).\n\nB- CRP/albumin ratio SA and CRP levels are obtained from the results of blood samples taken immediately during admission to the emergency department. CAR values were obtained by dividing the CRP level by the SA level.(4).\n\nC- Tri-glycerides glucose index TyG index is calculated as ln \\[fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL).(7).\n\nD- Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio Complete blood count is obtained from taken immediately during admission to the emergency department.NLR values were obtained by dividing the neutrophil count by lymphocyte count.(5).\n\nE- Atherogenic index The atherogenic index is calculated by using the following formula: log10 (TG/HDL-C)7 and classified as follows: 0.3 to 0.1 indicated a low risk, 0.1 to 0.24 indicated a medium risk, and more than 0.24 indicated a high risk of CVD. (9).\n\nF- Whole blood viscosity WBV at a high shear rate (HSR) (208 sec-1) and a low shear rate (LSR) (0.5 sec-1) were determined using HTC (percent) and total protein (g/l) levels; WBV at HSR (208 sec-1) = (0.12 × HTC) + (0.17 × \\[total protein-2.07\\]) and WBV at LSR (0.5 sec-1) = (1.89 × HTC) + (3.76 × \\[total protein-78.42\\]) (10)\n\nE-Angiographic analysis for determination of thrombus burden:\n\nThe angiographic data will be revised by two experienced interventional cardiologists. Intracoronary thrombus at baseline are angiographically identified and scored according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) thrombus grade (11). grade 0 (G0) no angiographic characteristics of thrombus are present; grade 1 (G1) possible thrombus is present, with angiographic characteristics as reduced contrast density, haziness, irregular lesion contour, or a smooth convex meniscus, suggestive but not diagnostic of thrombus; grade 2 (G2) there is definite thrombus with greatest dimensions 1/2 or less of the vessel diameter; grade 3 (G3) there is definite thrombus with greatest linear dimension greater than 1/2 but less than 2 vessel diameters; grade 4 (G4) there is definite thrombus with the largest dimension at least 2 vessel diameters; grade 5 (G5) there is total occlusion.\n\nF. Type of stent G. Echocardiography: for assessment of left side function systolic and diastolic function, right side systolic function \\& valvular affection.\n\nAll echocardiographic measurements will be performed according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography using a high -resolution Phillips machine.\n\nH. In hospital MACE\n\nA total of 0 to 3 points on the HEART score is considered low risk, with a risk of 0.6% to 1.7% for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the four to six weeks after presentation. A score of 4 to 6 is intermediate risk (16.6% risk of MACE), and 7 to 10 points is high risk (50.1% risk of MACE). (12)\n\nClinical follow-up:\n\nInformation about the survival status of all patients through hospital records and contact with patients and their relatives.\n\nInformation on hospitalization and cardiovascular events will be obtained through health questionnaires. If necessary, referring cardiologists and general practitioners were contacted for additional data. In case of re-hospitalization medical records or discharge letters from other hospitals will be collected. Clinical follow-up was performed at 6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["STEMI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"PPCI","description":"PPCI for patients of STEMI to assess thrombus burden"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To evaluate the effect different factors on thrombus burden in patients with STEMI.","description":"To evaluate the effect different factors on thrombus burden in patients with STEMI.","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Impact of these factors on patients outcomes at 6 months.","description":"Impact of these factors on patients outcomes at 6 months.","timeFrame":"18 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients admitted with STEMI undergoing PPCI will be recruited in the study and the period of data collection will be continued for 12 months.
