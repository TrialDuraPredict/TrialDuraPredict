The questionnaire covers nine aspects: basic information of the participants, symptoms and previous examinations, medical history and surgical history, medication history, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, dietary habits, physical exercise, and family history. After quality control, the data is entered by staff into the Zhejiang Province Cancer Screening Information Platform. Combining the results of the Helicobacter pylori test and the fecal immunochemical test, the system identifies high-risk individuals who need clinical screening. Additionally, stool, urine, blood, tongue coating, saliva, tongue appearance, gastric juice, and fresh tissue (gastric mucosa tissue and/or intestinal polyp tissue) samples are collected from all participants undergoing clinical screening.\n\nParticipants are required to complete at least one passive follow-up annually. Active follow-ups are conducted for those with positive screening results to ensure timely completion of endoscopic examinations. For those who have not undergone endoscopic examinations despite positive screening results, health education is provided, and they are mobilized to complete at least four endoscopic examinations within one month. For participants diagnosed and treated for precancerous lesions and tumors, diagnostic and treatment data must be collected, and they are encouraged to follow up as per medical advice. Both active and passive follow-up results must be recorded in the screening follow-up information record form and reported to the Zhejiang Province Cancer Screening Information Platform.\n\nThis is a government collaboration project. All subjects will also be followed by record linkage to Cancer Register and Population Register."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gastrointestinal Tumors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"stool, urine, blood, tongue coating, saliva, gastric juice, and fresh tissue (gastric mucosa tissue and/or intestinal polyp tissue)."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Screening cohort","description":"Healthy participants aged 40-74 years from Fenghua District, Ningbo City.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: questionnaire, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) test, fecal immunochemical test (FIT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"questionnaire, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) test, fecal immunochemical test (FIT)","description":"The questionnaire covers nine aspects: basic information of the participants, symptoms and previous examinations, medical history and surgical history, medication history, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, dietary habits, physical exercise, and family history.","armGroupLabels":["Screening cohort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Combined screening assessment results","description":"Systematically assessed based on questionnaire information combined with Helicobacter pylori test and fecal immunochemical test results.","timeFrame":"5 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Early diagnosis rate of gastrointestinal tumors","description":"To compare the early diagnosis rates of gastrointestinal tumors using different biomarkers.","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject residents from Fenghua District, Ningbo City.\n* Subject is able to comprehend, sign, and date the written informed consent document to participate in the study.\n* Subject has psychical condition and well consciousness, and also accept and cooperate with the follow-up of this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject has heavy cardiovascular, liver or kidney disease.\n* Subject is already suffering from malignant tumors of the digestive tract.\n* Subject has severe intellectual disabilities or language communication barriers.\n* Subject has had gastrointestinal endoscopy in the past year.","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"74 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Population data obtained from local government departments is used to identify eligible participants.
