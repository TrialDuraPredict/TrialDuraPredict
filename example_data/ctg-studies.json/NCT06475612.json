Early identification and risk stratification in trauma patients are crucial for timely medical interventions. The Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score (GTOS), designed by incorporating age, the Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the need for packed red blood cell transfusion, has emerged as a valuable prognostic tool for elderly trauma patients, but its applicability to general trauma patients remains underexplored."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Trauma Injury"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40068,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Trauma Patients","description":"The study cohort included 46,808 trauma patients from the Trauma Registry System, covering the period from 2009 to 2021.
