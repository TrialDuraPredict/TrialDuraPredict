In contrast to common neuraxial techniques such as paravertebral and epidural injections, the ESPB targets an interfascial plane which is far from the spinal cord, root, and pleura. First applied to thoracic neuropathic pain, currently ESPB is being applied to postoperative pain control and includes variable clinical situations. In the abdomen and thoracic wall, thoracic ESPB can be applied for pain control after cardiac surgery, video-assisted thoracic surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and thoracotomy. Recently, favorable postoperative pain control after lumbar spinal or lower limb surgeries has been reported with lumbar ESPB. In addition, ESPB has also been used for chronic pain conditions in the upper and lower extremities. To investigate the possible mechanism of action of the ESPB, many previous studies have focused on examining the physical spread of the injected agent. Commonly, contrast dye injections in human cadavers have been utilized to assess the spread level. Physical spread level was determined using various methods including direct dissection or sectioning, computed tomography (CT), thoracoscopic inspection, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with radiocontrast injection. Apart from human cadaver studies, physical spread level has been evaluated in alive patients using a variable volume of local anesthetics mixed with radiocontrast. Perfusion index is an indirect method which can present the degree of peripheral perfusion. Moreover, it is known as a more sensitive measurement tool than the rise of skin temperature. The apply of perfusion index is very simple and noninvasive. The degree of PI increase has been used to determine the success of peripheral nerve block. The volume of local anesthetics has been used 10-30 ml. However, most effective dosage with proper pain relief has never been suggested."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Erector Spinea Plane Block"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"10 ml lumbar ESPB group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"lumbar ESPB was performed by ultrasound guidance using curved probe with 10 ml of local anesthetics","interventionNames":["Procedure: erector spinae plane block"]},{"label":"20 ml lumbar ESPB group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"lumbar ESPB was performed by ultrasound guidance using curved probe with 20 ml of local anesthetics","interventionNames":["Procedure: erector spinae plane block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"erector spinae plane block","description":"fascial plane injection using ultrasound","armGroupLabels":["10 ml lumbar ESPB group","20 ml lumbar ESPB group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numerical rating scale changes among 5 times period","description":"minimum (1) and maximum value (10), lower score means better outcome","timeFrame":"Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks after the completion of erector spine plane block"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"back pain functional scale among 3 times period","description":"minimum (0) and maximum value (60), higher score means better outcome","timeFrame":"Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks after the completion of erector spine plane block"},{"measure":"Perfusion index changes among 4 times period","description":"erfusion index changes after lumbar ESPB among 4 times period","timeFrame":"baseline, 10minutes after ESPB, 20 minutes after ESPB, 30 minutes after ESPB"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* lumbar disc herniation\n* lumbar foraminal stenosis\n* lumbar central stenosis\n* lumbar spondylolisthesis\n* numerical rating scale \\> 4\n* back pain functional scale \\< 45\n* duration of pain \\> 1 mon\n* patients who can fully understand all items described in back pain functional scale\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Allergy to local anesthetics or contrast medium\n* Pregnancy\n* Spine deformity\n* Prior history of lumbar spine surgery\n* No previous lumbar MRI or CT\n* Patients with coagulation abnormality","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ji H Hong","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01046794343","email":"swon13@daum.net"},{"name":"Ji Hoon Park","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0532587760","email":"cmjihoon@gmail.com"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Hong ji HEE","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Daegu","zip":"42601","country":"Korea, Republic of","contacts":[{"name":"J Hee Hong","role":"CONTACT","phone":"82-53-258-7767","email":"swon13@daum.net"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":35.87028,"lon":128.59111}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13066","name":"Pain","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4107","name":"Anesthetics","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4109","name":"Anesthetics, Local","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
