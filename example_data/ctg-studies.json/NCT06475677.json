The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nDoes therapy from the OrthoCor Advanced System improve symptoms of osteoarthritis?\n\nResearchers will compare range of motion measurements, sit to stand test results, and functional survey answers to see if there are any changes after 4 weeks of therapy with the OrthoCor Advanced System.\n\nParticipants will use the OrthoCor Active System for 30 minutes twice daily and complete recovery measurements daily using an application."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Osteoarthritis, Knee","Osteo Arthritis Knee"],"keywords":["PEMF","Pulsed ElectroMagnetic Field"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"As osteoarthritis is a chronic condition, outcomes will be compared to baseline measurements for the same participant.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OrthoCor Advanced System","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Device: OrthoCor Advanced System"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"OrthoCor Advanced System","description":"The OrthoCor Advanced System is a portable battery-operated non-invasive device that delivers Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) plus heat therapy for general use pain relief.
