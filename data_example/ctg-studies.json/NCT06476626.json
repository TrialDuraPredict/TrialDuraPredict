The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDoes MRF mediates the connection between risk factors for mental health difficulties during first pregnancy and motherhood (the transition to motherhood) and outcomes related to the mother, the infant, and their relationship.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nAnswer questionnaires and clinical interviews during pregnancy and after birth of the first child (twice at third trimester, 1 and 3 months after birth).\n\nintervention group will participate in an online short intervention to enhance MRF.","detailedDescription":"Using this trial, the investigators will be able to better understand rather MRF moderate the connection between risk factors to outcomes after birth related to both the mother and the infant.
