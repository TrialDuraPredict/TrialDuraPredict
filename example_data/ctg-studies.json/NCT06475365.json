The study population will consist of generally healthy adults ages 18 - 80. The main question it aims to answer is:\n\nIf the symptomatology and severity of swallowing difficulties following ACDF surgery can be reduced by gargling with warm salt water.\n\nResearchers will compare the control and interventional arms to see if the proposed intervention of gargling with warm salt water improves difficulty swallowing following surgery.\n\nPatients in the control arm will be asked to:\n\n- Complete three (3) questionnaires at specified intervals (preoperative, postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, and 7; and at 1-month postoperatively).\n\nPatients in the experimental/interventional arm will be asked to:\n\n* Complete three (3) questionnaires at specified intervals (preoperative, postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, and 7; and at 1-month postoperatively).\n* Gargle with a warm saltwater solution once on POD 0, and thrice daily from POD 1 to POD 7.","detailedDescription":"Background \\& Hypothesis:\n\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, often signifies structural or functional abnormalities in any of the three phases of swallowing and contributes to higher self-reported disability and lower physical health status. Dysphagia is a common postoperative complication following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. While most experience mild and transient symptoms, some individuals endure severe dysphagia, leading to significant postoperative morbidity.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the efficacy of corticosteroids administered intraoperatively during ACDF procedures. One prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, showed favorable results with local corticosteroid administration, resulting in a significant decrease in dysphagia during the immediate postoperative period to 1-month postoperatively. Although other studies have also reported favorable outcomes with corticosteroid use, they are still associated with considerable risks of adverse events. Corticosteroids have been linked to a higher incidence of postoperative infection, impairment of wound healing, and a 2- to 5-fold increase in wound complications across a variety of surgical specialties.\n\nSalt water, also known as saline is associated with anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and wound healing properties. Warm salt water rinses offer a more accessible, cost-effective alternative to corticosteroids, without their associated adverse effects. The study aims to investigate the efficacy of gargling salt water in reducing the severity and symptoms of swallowing difficulties following multi-level ACDF procedures.\n\nThis study is a single-center, prospective, randomized control trial. Only patients ≥ 18 years of age who are undergoing a multi-level (2-, 3-, or 4-level ACDF) and meet the general inclusion criterion will be invited to participate in the study.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Patients will be screened using the general inclusion/exclusion parameters\n2. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: control or experimental using a 1:1 ratio\n3. Patients will complete three (3) questionnaires at selected time points throughout the study duration\n4. Patients in the experimental arm will be asked to gargle with a saltwater solution one (1) time on POD 0 and three (3) times per day with approximately 15 milliliters (mL) per mouthful for seven (7) days (POD 1 - POD 7) + scheduled questionnaires\n5. Patients in the control arm will only be asked to complete the scheduled questionnaires\n\nRequired questionnaires:\n\n1. Swallow Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QOL)\n2. Visual Analogue Scale - Neck (VAS Neck)\n3. Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)\n\nGeneral study execution:\n\nPatients in the interventional arm will be provided with a premade sodium chloride (sterile saltwater solution), 8-ounce-marked measuring cups, and a detailed instruction sheet with the relevant contacts for the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Degeneration Spine","Cervical Radiculopathy","Cervical Stenosis","Cervical Spondylosis","Cervical Myelopathy","Dysphagia"],"keywords":["ACDF","Anterior cervical discectomy & fusion","Cervical spine","Dysphagia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Control (no intervention) \\& experimental (intervention).
