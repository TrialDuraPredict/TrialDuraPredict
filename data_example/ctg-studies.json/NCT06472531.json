The specific endpoints include evaluating the safety, Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), Accumulation (%ID), Retention Time, Absorbed Dose, Effective Dose, and PK parameters in whole blood, plasma, and urine following an intravenous administration of INR101.\n\nPhase II Study Objective: This phase aims to determine the diagnostic efficacy of INR101 injection PET/CT scans in patients with suspected prostate cancers. The principal aim is to ascertain the optimal imaging conditions, which involve determining the best dose and timing of administration. This will be gauged based on the diagnostic performance metrics-sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy-of the INR101 injection PET/CT at different dosages and imaging intervals, using prostate biopsy pathology results as the reference standard."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy Male Subjects","Suspected Prostate Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"phase I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental: INR101 PET/ CT\n\nDrug: INR101.","interventionNames":["Drug: INR101"]},{"label":"phase II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Experimental: INR101 PET/ CT\n\nInterventions:\n\nDrug: INR101","interventionNames":["Drug: INR101"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"INR101","description":"• 9±1 mCi of INR101 will be injected intravenously prior to perform the PET/CT","armGroupLabels":["phase I"],"otherNames":["INR101 PET CT"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"INR101","description":"* 9±1 mCi of INR101 will be injected intravenously prior to perform the PET/CT\n* 7±1 mCi of INR101 will be injected intravenously prior to perform the PET/CT","armGroupLabels":["phase II"],"otherNames":["INR101 PET CT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Phase I primary outcome: incidence of adverse events of INR101 injection","description":"Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.","timeFrame":"7 days after administration"},{"measure":"Phase I primary outcome:radiation dosimetry","description":"Mean absorbed radiation doses were estimated using the source and target organ framework.
