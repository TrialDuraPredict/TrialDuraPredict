This study aims to collect preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of C-REX a real-word setting.","detailedDescription":"Despite technological advancements, the rate of anastomotic leak after left colon and rectal resection remains high. In most cases, these complications are identified only from the clinical symptoms and the delay in the diagnosis may lead to more severe outcomes. The device C-REX, developed by CarpoNovum, may help the anastomosis construction, providing at the same time a system to monitor the anastomosis until complete healing. This may lead to reduced anastomotic leak rate and severity. This study aims to collect preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of C-REX to develop a future larger multicentric trial. The objective of the study is to provide preliminary data to determine whether the C-REX device may reduce the rate and severity of anastomotic leak after left colon and high rectal resection, providing new insights on the feasibility and effectiveness of the C-REX device in a real-word setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Colorectal Neoplasms"],"keywords":["Colorectal Neoplasm","Anastomosis","Surgical device"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Pilot, single-center, interventional, prospective case-series study.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"C-REX","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive the C-REX device during anastomosis construction","interventionNames":["Device: C-REX"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"C-REX","description":"The C-REX is a CE-marked class IIa device consisting of an invasive surgical part, including two anastomotic rings, intended for short-term use, and surgical instruments LapAid and RectoAid for assisting the placement of the anastomotic ring to intestine.
