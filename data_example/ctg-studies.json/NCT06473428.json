PD often leads to breathing difficulties and voice abnormalities due to weakened respiratory muscles and reduced diaphragm mobility. The study will involve 45 participants with PD, randomly assigned to three groups: one group will perform inspiratory muscle training, the second group will perform both inspiratory and expiratory muscle training, and the third group will receive placebo-controlled expiratory muscle training. The hypothesis is that targeted respiratory muscle training will significantly improve pulmonary function, diaphragm excursion, and phonatory measures compared to the placebo group. The findings aim to develop effective rehabilitation strategies to enhance the quality of life and communication abilities in individuals with PD.","detailedDescription":"This study aims to investigate the effects of respiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, diaphragm excursion, and phonatory measures in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD often leads to weakened respiratory muscles, reduced diaphragm movement, and voice abnormalities, impacting breathing and communication. The study will recruit 45 patients with PD, who will be randomly assigned to three groups: an inspiratory muscle training group, a combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training group, and a placebo-controlled expiratory muscle training group. Over eight weeks, participants will perform daily training sessions, with the intensity of the exercises adjusted periodically. Assessments will include pulmonary function tests, ultrasound measurements of diaphragm thickness and movement, and various phonatory evaluations. The hypothesis is that respiratory muscle training will significantly improve respiratory and phonatory functions in PD patients compared to placebo, providing insights into effective rehabilitation strategies for enhancing their quality of life and communication abilities."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Parkinson Disease","Pulmonary Disease","Voice Disorders"],"keywords":["Parkinson's disease","Pulmonary function","Respiratory muscle training","Diaphragm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Inspiratory Muscle Training","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in this group will undergo a specific inspiratory muscle training program.
