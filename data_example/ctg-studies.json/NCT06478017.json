Sixty-six (66) primary heart transplant recipients will be randomized (1:2) to receive either standard-of-care, tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, or a belatacept-based regimen with gradual tacrolimus withdrawal over 9-months post-transplant. Both study arms will receive CellCept速 (mycophenolate mofetil- MMF) or Myfortic速 (mycophenolate sodium). Corticosteroids will be continued throughout the study in the belatacept arm.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate whether NULOJIX速 (belatacept), when implemented with gradual tacrolimus withdrawal over 9 months, is safe with respect to preventing the composite endpoint of acute cellular rejection (ACR) \\>= International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2R, hemodynamic compromise rejection in the absence of a biopsy or histological rejection, re-transplantation, and death at 18 months post-transplant."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Heart Transplant"],"keywords":["Heart transplant","Transplantation","Standard of care","Belatacept","Tacrolimus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Belatacept + Tacrolimus withdrawal","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1.
