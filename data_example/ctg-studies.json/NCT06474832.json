Increased gait variability and asymmetry contributes to a higher risk of falls, leading to reduced physical activity, decreased cardiorespiratory endurance, and increased walking economy and sympathetic nervous system activity, thereby potentially triggering secondary strokes. Previous studies have primarily focused on the significant improvements in walking endurance and speed with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a treadmill, leaving a gap in understanding the effects of HIIT on oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) and gait quality for stroke individuals using a stationary bicycle ergometer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of HIIT using a stationary bicycle ergometer on improving cardiorespiratory fitness and gait quality in individuals with chronic stroke."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Stroke"],"keywords":["High-intensity interval training","Cardiorespiratory fitness","Gait quality","Chronic Stroke"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-intensity interval training group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention is a 42-minute session and 3-sessions/week, totaling 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: High-intensity interval training"]},{"label":"Moderate intensity continuous training group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The intervention is a 45-minute session and 3-sessions/week, totaling 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: Moderate intensity continuous training"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"High-intensity interval training","description":"Training on a stationary bike, including a warm-up and cool-down at 30% HRR for 5 minutes each.
