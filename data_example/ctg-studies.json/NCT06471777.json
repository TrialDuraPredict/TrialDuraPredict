Congestion resulting from fluid accumulation is believed to contribute to organ failure. Removal of excess fluid is a central component of dialysis treatment, also known as kidney replacement therapy (KRT). However, there remain important knowledge gaps in our ability to remove excess fluid effectively and safely. If fluid is removed too slowly, fluid overload and its complications persist for longer. If fluid is removed too fast during KRT, patient's blood pressure may drop (ie hemodynamic instability may occur) which may precipitate complications.\n\nThe optimal fluid management strategy is currently unknown.\n\nThe PROBE Fluid UK study is a randomized clinical trial comparing a protocol-based fluid removal strategy with usual care in critically ill patients with AKI receiving KRT. The fluid management protocol is intended to achieve neutral or negative daily fluid balance by both preventing and treating fluid accumulation.\n\nThe primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the intervention results in a difference in cumulative fluid balance from day of randomization to 5 days later. Secondary outcomes will include short-term patient outcomes, safety outcomes, and health resource utilization related to KRT delivery."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Renal Failure on Dialysis (Disorder)"],"keywords":["acute kidney injury","dialysis","fluid removal"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Protocol-based fluid removal","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The intervention will consist of 3 components:\n\nThe first component of this prescription will be to define the 24h-fluid balance target.
