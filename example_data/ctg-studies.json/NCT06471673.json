Subjects will continue to be followed for time on subsequent therapy (PFS2) and survival by phone call or medical record review, every 3 months for up to 2 years.\n\nStudy Drug, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:\n\nThe Part 1 monotherapy phase of Phase 1 will proceed as follows for each patient:\n\nSubject 1, Q2w for 4 doses Subject 2, Q2w for 4 doses Subject 3, Q2w for 4 doses\n\nInitially, safety will be assessed on these 3 subjects. DLTs are defined as CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that are suspected to be possibly related to study treatment.\n\nIf 1 of 3 Phase 1 subjects experience a DLT, that dose cohort will be expanded to another 3 patients before the combinational phase begins. If none of the patients in the expanded cohort experience a DLT (DLT rate of 1/4), the study will move into Bria-OTS and CPI combination. The dose for the combination will be either the highest dose at which no DLT is observed among the first 3 patients or the 3 patient expanded cohort dose level. In Phase 1, DLTs for determining the combinational BC1 dose will be observed until the first scheduled assessment. If the Phase 1 DLT rate is â‰¥ 2/4, an additional 3 patients will be dosed using the next lower dose level or 10 million cells (whichever is higher). If none of the 3 subjects experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), that determined BC1 MTD dose will be included in the Part 2 combinational phase of Phase 1 along with a CPI. If a tolerated dose for BC1 cell line cannot be identified, further investigation will be paused, the data reviewed and may resume at a lower dose only with protocol amendment and IRB approval.\n\nFollowing the Phase 1, Part 1 monotherapy phase, 3 patients will be treated every 3 weeks with the Bria-OTS regimen with a CPI in the Part 2 combination phase. The Bria-OTS regimen consists of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 2-3 days prior to BC1 cell line inoculation. On the same day as the cell inoculation, subjects will receive peginterferon alpha-2a. Subjects will also receive the CPI on the same day of the cell inoculation according to approved dosing.\n\nOnce 3 patients have been safely treated with the Bria-OTS regimen and CPI for 2 cycles, Phase 2 will enroll an expansion cohort, consisting of up to an additional 9 subjects (for a total of 12 treated with the Bria-OTS regimen and CPI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer","Breast Tumor","Cancer of Breast","Cancer of the Breast","Malignant Tumor of Breast","Tumors, Breast"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1, Part 1 Monotherapy Phase","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subject 1, Q2w for 4 doses\n\nSubject 2, Q2w for 4 doses\n\nSubject 3, Q2w for 4 doses Treatment is administered every 2 weeks for a total of 4 doses.\n\nInitially, safety will be assessed on these 3 subjects.
