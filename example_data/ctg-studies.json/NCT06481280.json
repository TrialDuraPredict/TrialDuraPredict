There will be monthly visit and parents will be asked to fill in diaries.","detailedDescription":"Briefly, on two separate days, the placebo formula and the TEHCF will be introduced at increasing doses under medical supervision, and appearance of allergic symptoms will be witnessed and recorded if any. The week after, and more particularly the 72 hours after each food challenge day, child's parents will be instructed to report to the investigator any delayed reaction that may occur. In case the TEHCF induces an allergic reaction, the child's participation will be ended. Otherwise, the child will enter the second study part, lasting 4 months and during which the usual formula taken by the child will be totally replaced by the TEHCF."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cow's Milk Allergy"],"keywords":["CMA (Cow's Milk Allergy)","DBPCFC (Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Food Challenge)","FA (Food Allergy)","IgE (Immunoglobulin E)","OFC (Oral Food Challenge)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"The first part of the study consists in a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) during which all patient will receive the test formula and a placebo, in a randomised order.\n\nDuring the second part of the study, all patients will be fed the test formula (open-label phase).","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Masking only applies to the 1st part of the study : during this part all parties (participant, care provide, investigator and outcomes assessor) will be blinded.\n\nThe 2nd study part is open-label , there is no masking during this phase","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Test Formula","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Infants will receive an extensively hydrolyzed formula during the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) and will continue on this formula during the open-label feeding phase if they tolerate it.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Test Formula","Dietary Supplement: Placebo Formula"]},{"label":"Placebo Formula","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Infants will receive a placebo formula (=their previous formula) during the DBPCFC to compare against the test formula.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Test Formula","Dietary Supplement: Placebo Formula"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Test Formula","description":"Infants will receive an extensively hydrolyzed formula during the double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) and will continue on this formula during the open-label feeding phase if they tolerate it.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo Formula","Test Formula"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Placebo Formula","description":"Infants will receive a placebo formula during the DBPCFC to compare against the test formula.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo Formula","Test Formula"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Hypoallergenicity of the formula","description":"the percentage of children tolerating the formula during the double blind placebo controlled food challenge","timeFrame":"7 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cow's Milk Related Symptom Score (CoMiSS™)","description":"The Cow's Milk Related Symptom Score (CoMiSS™) will be evaluated globally and each of its subscore.
