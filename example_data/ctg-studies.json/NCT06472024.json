The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n- Do manual acupuncture and medication therapy affect pain intensity as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) in patients with oral mucositis compared with sham manual acupuncture and medication?\n\nParticipants will receive acupuncture therapy 2 times a week for 3 weeks","detailedDescription":"This is a clinical trial study to evaluate the role of acupuncture in pain relief and improving the quality of life of nasopharyngeal cancer patients with post-radiotherapy mucositis. Participants were 30 men/females with mucositis in post-radiotherapy nasopharyngeal cancer aged 19-59 years. They will be divided into 2 groups: (1) verum acupuncture and (2) sham acupuncture. Acupuncture is scheduled 2 times per week for 3 weeks.

It consists of 35 questions covering various aspects such as pain, swallowing, speech, social eating, and emotional functioning. Each question is scored on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 representing \"not at all\" and 4 representing \"very much\".\n\nTo calculate a score for each domain, the individual item scores are averaged. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms or poorer quality of life in that domain.
