Thus, menstrually-related migraine provides an opportunity to study spontaneous attacks in a controlled imaging setup. The present project aims to investigate women with menstrually-related migraine using daily functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans 2-3 days before the onset of the menstrual bleeding and until (and including) the headache phase of migraine or up to five consecutive days. A control-group of women without migraine will also be recruited and undergo the same MRI scan protocol."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Menstrual-related migraine without aura","description":"Patients with menstrual-related migraine without aura"},{"label":"Healthy volunteers","description":"Healthy volunteers"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brain excitability and connectivity in migraine patients","description":"Changes in the migraine brain excitability and connectivity in areas related to migraine during the menstrual period.
