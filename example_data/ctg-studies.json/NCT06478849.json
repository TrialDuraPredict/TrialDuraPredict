As part of a therapeutic education program, we aim to validate the communication tools and messages identified by a panel of French experts. These messages, together with the article published by Petit et al, have enabled us to draw up a skills reference framework for patients with a PICC line.\n\nThe aim of this non-interventional project (RIPH3) is to evaluate patient adherence to the project and understanding of the messages in a prospective cohort of patients.\n\nThis project is part of a collaborative approach that includes the creation of a mobile application for therapeutic education."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Central Venous Lines","PICCline","Therapeutic Education Program","Prevention"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"QUESTIONNAIRES","description":"QUESTINNAIRES / WEBINARS","otherNames":["WEBINARS"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assess patients' level of understanding of communication tools.","description":"The level of comprehension will be assessed on the acquisition of the main messages and will be expressed as a percentage of correct answers.","timeFrame":"WEEK 6 POST INCLUSION"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Estimating patient adherence to communication tools","description":"Adherence to communication tools will be assessed by the frequency of participation in the various webinars proposed.","timeFrame":"WEEK 6 POST INCLUSION"},{"measure":"Identify individual factors : a- Demographic b- Related to underlying pathology c- Management-related","description":"age, gender, ethnic origin, mother language, lifestyle, place of residence...","timeFrame":"week 6 post inclusion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
