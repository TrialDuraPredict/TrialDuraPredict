It can treat fever, coma, delirium, epilepsy, convulsions in children, dental caries, throat swelling, oral sores, carbuncle, and furuncle.\n\nThe significant pathophysiological process of primary inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (hereinafter referred to as IIDD) is the activation of the immune system of the central nervous system and the enhancement of inflammation. It includes several common diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-related disease (MOGAD), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), concentric sclerosis, tumor-like inflammatory demyelinating disease, etc.\n\nCombined with the inspiration brought to us by the above background research, especially bilirubin and bile acid are closely related to intestinal digestive function, and CBS is clinically effective through oral administration by subjects, the investigators speculate that CBS is likely to exert its immune, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on the brain by changing the intestinal flora and regulating the brain-gut axis. In terms of symptoms, CBS is likely to have the effect of improving the clinical symptoms of IIDD subjects and reducing disability."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Idiopathic Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease","Multiple Sclerosis","Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder","Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-associated Disease","Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CBS therapy, CBS dosage: 100mg per day from day 1 to day 84, in IIDD cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects in IIDD cohort of this arm will receive general therapy plus CBS.","interventionNames":["Drug: Calculus bovis sativus (CBS)"]},{"label":"Control therapy: no intervention, in IIDD cohort.","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Subjects in IIDD cohort of this arm will only receive general therapy."},{"label":"CBS therapy, CBS dosage: 100mg per day from day 1 to day 84, in healthy cohort","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects in healthy cohort of this arm will only receive CBS.","interventionNames":["Drug: Calculus bovis sativus (CBS)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Calculus bovis sativus (CBS)","description":"Subjects will orally receive 100mg CBS per day from day 1 to day 84.","armGroupLabels":["CBS therapy, CBS dosage: 100mg per day from day 1 to day 84, in IIDD cohort","CBS therapy, CBS dosage: 100mg per day from day 1 to day 84, in healthy cohort"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","description":"To assess mRS of subjects within 12 weeks after treatment initiation.
