This open-label single-arm pilot clinical trial will test the impact of EC provision on: 1) study feasibility, 2) EC acceptability, 3) tobacco use behavior (e.g., cigarettes per day, EC use), and 4) biomarkers (e.g., carbon monoxide, cotinine, and anabasine). Participants will be asked to switch from combustible cigarettes to the NJOY ACE 5% nicotine electronic cigarette (EC) for 4 weeks. They will be followed an additional 4 weeks after EC provision ends (to 8 weeks).\n\nThe first study hypothesis is that more than 40% of eligible smokers who are offered participation in the trial will enroll, and that 75% of enrollees will complete the trial. The second study hypothesis is that participants will report fewer cigarettes smoked per day at the end of 4 weeks of EC provision, relative to their baseline values."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Electronic Cigarette Use","Smoking, Cigarette","Nicotine Dependence"],"keywords":["Tobacco Use Disorder"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open-label single-arm pilot clinical trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NJOY ACE e-cigarette provision","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Device: NJOY ACE e-cigarette, 5% nicotine in tobacco flavor\n\nPatients will be provided with a NJOY ACE electronic cigarette for 4 weeks and asked to use the NJOY ACE as a substitute for smoking combustible cigarettes during the 4 weeks.","interventionNames":["Other: NJOY ACE e-cigarette"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"NJOY ACE e-cigarette","description":"Patients will be provided with NJOY ACE electronic cigarettes and 5% nicotine e-liquid cartridges in tobacco flavor for 4 weeks and asked to use the electronic cigarette as a substitute for smoking combustible cigarettes during the 4 weeks","armGroupLabels":["NJOY ACE e-cigarette provision"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Study feasibility","description":"Participant enrollment, measured by the proportion of eligible participants following in-person screening who enroll in the study.
