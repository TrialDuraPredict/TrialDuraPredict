This afirmation is based on studies that analyze the impact of different dietary supplements along immobilization periods, stablishing that creatine, leucine and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could ameliorate muscle loss, while creatine could potentiate the hypertrophy along the rehabilitation process. For this reason, the aim of this study are to analyze the effect of creatine ingestion in pain, histological properties of the tendon, body composition, strength and vertical jump performance in athletes with patellar tendinopathy that follow a physical rehabilitation program that include eccentric exercise combined with stretching and extracorporeal shock wave therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Creatine","Patellar Tendinopathy"],"keywords":["Ergogenic aid","Dietary","Injury","Nutrition","Sport Nutrition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"A researcher who did not have any contact with the participants and the physiotherapist who performed the physical rehabilitation intervention and the assessments randomly divided the participants to the creatine or placebo groups in a computerized random list with a 1:1 allocation using the software Research Randomizer (www.randomizer.org).","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Creatine supplementation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Creatine monohydrate (Creapure®, Crown Sport Nutrition, Arnedo, Spain) ingested 3 capsules daily (3 g/day)","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Creatine supplementation"]},{"label":"Placebo supplementation","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Sucrose ingested 3 capsules daily (3 g/day)","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Creatine supplementation","description":"The supplements were provided in capsules of 1 g of red color not transparent Guinama S.L.U, 0044634, La Pobla de Valbona, Spain) which were prepared with a Capsunorm 2000 semi-automatic manual capsule filling machine (Miranda del Ebro, Spain).

Ultrasound gel was applied and evaluated by placing the probe longitudinally; in pathological tendons it is the only way to determine the distance of the measurement point from the insertion of the tendon.
