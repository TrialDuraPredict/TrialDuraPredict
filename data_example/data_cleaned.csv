NCT06478082,COMPLETED,2021-04-12,2023-07-03,"Rationale: In a way, VR-based gaming shows some similarities to Constraint-induced movement therapy. VR games are controlled unimanually or bimanually. When unimanually-controlled games are performed with the affected upper limb, movements of the unaffected hand are completely ineffective. This mimics the principle of forced use. To some degree, also bimanually-controlled games result in a forced use of the affected upper limb.

Additionally, VR could help in the engagement in rehabilitation programs, as virtual environments and gaming increases enjoyment and motivation, and therefore therapy adherence. Accordingly, VR-based gaming may have the potential to improve upper limb functionality in children with CP.

Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a home-based VR intervention to improve upper limb functionality in children with CP. Sub-objective: The validation of a self-developed upper limb assessment (Upper Limb Reaching Test).

Study population: Children and adolescents with unilateral CP (age 10-18 years old). Intervention: The intervention consists of VR-based rehabilitation with the Oculus Quest device. The training frequency and duration represents 2x15 minutes a day, five days a week, for a total of eight weeks. Therefore, this rehabilitation intervention should represent a total amount of 20 hours of rehabilitation. However, the total dosage is variable as the intervention is self-managed.

NCT06481254,COMPLETED,2024-02-06,2024-02-20,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that causes serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been increased rapidly over the past 30 years. According to the report of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Report, approximately 537 million people worldwide (700 million in 4045) have diabetes and 6.5 million people were reported to have died due to diabetes in 2021. In Turkey, it is estimated that approximately 9 million people (about 13.5 million in 2045) are diagnosed with diabetes and approximately 80 thousand people will die from diabetes.

Prolonged hyperglycemia in DM can lead to microvascular (nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease) complications. However, due to poorly controlled DM, complications can be seen in the oral mucosa of patients with many immunological and metabolic changes. Oral complications seen in patients with DM include hyposalivation, xerostomia, bacterial, viral and fungal infections, poor wound healing, increased severity and incidence of caries, gingivitis and periodontal disease, periapical abscess, and burning mouth syndrome (BMS). These complications can lead to the development of oral mucositis in patients.

Many pharmacological and non-pharmacological agents are used in the prevention/treatment of oral mucositis. According to the classification of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCAM), complementary therapies methods are divided into three groups as nutritional, psychological and physiological and other complementary approaches. However, it is reported in the literature that complementary therapies such as cryotherapy (oral cooling), honey, propolis, vitamin E, selenium, aloe vera, black mulberry, apple cider vinegar, rose water and green tea are effective in the treatment of oral mucositis. Again in the literature, there are studies in which the effect of black mulberry syrup in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), apple cider vinegar and rose water mixture in cancer patients and green tea in the treatment of oral mucositis has been proven.

Oral mucositis is one of the oral diseases that can cause oral dysfunction, dysphagia and reduced oral health-related quality of life in patients. Oral and dental health affects a person's quality of life by affecting their physiological, psychological and social functioning. However, improving oral health is part of nursing care. In order to maintain a good quality of life, it is necessary to improve awareness of oral complications that occur in patients with DM. In the literature reviewed, only one experimental study was found in cancer patients in which oral mucositis-related quality of life was evaluated. There is no international or Turkish study on the treatment of oral mucositis in patients with DM. There are also no studies comparing hawthorn vinegar, black mulberry syrup and green tea in different sample groups.

When chest physiotherapy is not performed effectively and regularly, the child has increased hospital admis-sion, prolonged hospitalization, restricted daily activities, loss of independence, decreased qua-lity of life and social isolation. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to present the results of the effect of pinwheel breathing exercise on quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis.

METHODS This study was conducted in a single-center, prospective randomized controlled design. The sample size of the study was calculated in G\*Power 3.1.9.2 (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany). The sample size was found to be 35 for each group. The study authors considered possible sample losses during the study process. It was decided to conduct the study with a total of 70 children. There were 35 children in each group (research and control group). Between January and April 2024, 81 children aged 6-11 years with CF who were enrolled in the Pediatric Chest Outpatient Clinic of Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital were included in this study. Among these children, 70 children who met the inclusion criteria were included. Children who did not come to the Pediatric Chest Outpatient Clinic for routine controls (n=10) and children whose parents refused to participate in the study (n=1) were excluded.

Procedures:

Participants were assigned to groups, and the pinwheels to be given to the intervention group were placed in the location to be used in the interviews. Vital signs, Child Health Status Diagnosis Form (CHDSDF), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) and Breathing Exercise Application and Follow-up Form (NEUTF) and all records were documented by the first researcher. The first researcher has 2.5 years of experience as a pediatric intensive care and pediatric ward nurse. The pediatric chest outpatient clinic works in a single shift during the day (08:00-16:00). In this study, the following procedures were performed respectively. Initial assessments of children with CF registered in the pediatric chest outpatient clinic were performed between 08:00 and 16:00 at their own scheduled appointment hours. The parent and child who arrived at their own appointment time (between 08:00 and 16:00) were invited to the examination room, their clinical condition was evaluated, and the children to be included in the research and control groups were determined. The parents of the children to be included in the intervention group were informed about all stages of the research process and their verbal and written consent was obtained. Children were randomly assigned to the groups by simple randomization method. Randomization was made according to the daily examination appointment order of the pediatric pulmonology outpatient clinic of the hospital. The research and control groups were determined by drawing lots. Children with an odd number of appointments were included in the intervention group and those with an even number were included in the control group. For example, the child whose examination appointment was in the 1st place was included in the intervention group and the child whose appointment was in the 2nd place was included in the control group. This method was repeated until the sample size was reached. In this study, all assessments were performed in the same way for children in the research and control groups. In this study, vital signs, pulmonary function test values and quality of life data of the children were re-evaluated at different time periods. These time periods were: pre-intervention and the first appointment day after the intervention (at least 3 months). Pre-intervention covers the interval between the appointments scheduled from 08:00 to 16:00 for the child's first evaluation. Post-intervention covers the interval between the appointments scheduled from 08:00 to 16:00 for the child's second evaluation after 3 months. Factors determining children's quality of life were evaluated twice, before and after the intervention. The vital signs and pulmonary function test values of the children were measured once on the day of the intervention (between 08:00 and 16:00 appointment hours). Console type pulse oximeter and pulmonary function test device (spirometer) were used. All data except the vital signs of the children were asked the mothers and children face to face and their answers were recorded in the CFQ-R.

Instruments:

Data were collected using the Child Health Status Diagnostic Form (CHSDF), the Cystic Fibro-sis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) and the Breathing Exercise Practice and Follow-up Form (BEPFF). The CFQ-R and BEPFF were developed by the researcher and the counselor after reviewing the relevant literature. Child Health Status Diagnosis Form (CHSDF): In the first part of this form, there are 3 open-ended questions about the child's diagnosis date, other diseases and medications that the child is constantly taking. The other part of the form consists of 3 secti-ons. These 3 sections include the first and second assessment. If the first assessment is to be made, the first assessment box will be filled in and if the second assessment is to be made, the second assessment box will be filled in. The evaluation parameters for each section are speci-fied. In this study, the CFQ-R form was used for the 6-11 age group. This form consists of two parts and all questions are equally weighted. In the first part, there are 5 questions about the child's date of birth, gender, absence from school in the last two weeks due to vacation or non-health related reasons, racial origin and grade level. In the second part, 35 questions assessing children's physical functioning (questions 1-6), emotional functioning (questions 7-14), social functioning (questions 15,16,19), treatment burden (questions 17,18,29), respiratory (questions 31-34) and digestive findings (question 35) in the last two weeks.

The scale score is made with the online application on https://cfqr-app.netlify.app/#/questionnaire prepared by Quittner et al. It is calculated by obtaining a score between 0-100 for each sub-heading. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. Breathing Exercise Practice and Follow-up Form (BEPFF): This form is used to describe how the children in the study group should perform the breathing exercise during the breathing exercise with the pinwheel. It is composed of 7 rows with instructions. Opposite each row, 7 columns with 2-week evaluation time and 2 columns for each evaluation time to be marked ""morning"" and ""eve-ning"" were added. The boxes in front of the morning and evening breathing exercises were marked with a ""✓"" sign. In the study, a pinwheel was used to ensure and improve the continuity of children's breathing exercises and to increase lung capacity. This pinwheel has a structure consisting of multiple small wings mounted on a handle. It consists of 8 wings with 18 cm in diameter and it is 38 cm in total length. The pinwheel is usually made of durable paper material, so it can be used over and over again. The easy rotating structure of the pinwheel makes it simp-le and easy for children to use. These features ensure that children aged 3 and above can easily use the pinwheel.

Intervention:

Children in the study and control groups enrolled in the pediatric chest outpatient clinic were monitored with a pulse oximetry device and pulmonary function test device. Vital signs and pulmonary function test values were measured and recorded at their scheduled appointments between 08:00 and 16:00 on the day of the intervention. Before the intervention (1st Assess-ment), the children's information was recorded in the pretest CFQ-R. Each child in the research group was given a pinwheel at their appointment time. The child was given the BEPFF and instructions on how to use the form were explained in detail. In line with the BEPFF, the child was told to sit in a chair suitably, remove their surgical mask and take the pinwheel in the hand that they dominantly use. In line with BEPFF, the child was instructed to perform the breathing exercise with the pinwheel and whether the application was performed correctly was evaluated in detail. The child repeated the breathing exercise several times in order to perform it correctly.

The child who was observed to perform the breathing exercise correctly in accordance with the BEPFF was instructed to perform this exercise twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, for 3 months at home. In order to encourage the children to continue the breathing exercises regularly, reminder messages were sent via phone messaging once a week for 3 months. Child-ren in the control group were not given pinwheel and BEPFF was not applied. Children in this group continued their routine treatment processes. Post-intervention evaluations (2nd evalua-tion) of the children in the research and control groups were conducted at the follow-up appo-intments scheduled 3 months later. Vital signs and pulmonary function test values were measu-red and recorded at their scheduled appointments between 08:00 and 16:00. Factors affecting quality of life were asked face-to-face and the answers were recorded on the post-test CFQ-R.","['Nursing Caries', 'Breathing Exercise']",INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],70,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,"[{'type': 'DEVICE', 'name': 'Pinwheel', 'description': 'The children in the intervention group were given breathing exercises with pinwheels.', 'armGroupLabels': ['Pinwheel Group']}]","[{'measure': ""Identifying children's quality of life"", 'description': ""The child's routine implementation and follow-up of the breathing exercise was assessed."", 'timeFrame': '3 months of routine implementation and follow-up of breathing exercise and change in quality of life of children.'}]","Inclusion Criteria:

MPS II is a lysosomal storage disease with an X-linked recessive inheritance type, which is characterized by a decrease in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S), caused by a mutation in the IDS gene. Enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in lysosomes, mainly fractions of heparan and dermatan sulfates. Because of the insufficient activity of iduronate sulfatase participating in the first stage of catabolism of GAG, they accumulate in lysosomes of almost all types of cells of various tissues and organs. The disease is manifested by growth retardation, damage of many organs and systems, severe deformations of bones and joints, gross facial features, pathology of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, damage to parenchymal organs (hepatosplenomegaly), hearing impairment. A severe form of the disease occurs with the involvement of the nervous system in the pathological process, including mental retardation, behavior anomalies, and impaired motor function.

GNR 055 (verenafusp alfa) is a modified enzyme I2S capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier and thus it is expected to prevent neurodegenerative consequences and the development of cognitive deficit in the future that will allow achieving a significant improvement in the life quality and expectancy of patients with MPS II.","['Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II', 'Metabolic Diseases']",INTERVENTIONAL,['PHASE1'],18,OTHER,"[{'type': 'BIOLOGICAL', 'name': 'Cohort 1: 6 mg/kg', 'description': 'Single intravenous administration of 6 mg/kg of verenafusp alfa', 'armGroupLabels': ['verenafusp alfa 6 mg/kg intravenously'], 'otherNames': ['verenafusp alfa', 'GNR-055']}, {'type': 'BIOLOGICAL', 'name': 'Cohort 2: 9 mg/kg', 'description': 'Single intravenous administration of 9 mg/kg of verenafusp alfa', 'armGroupLabels': ['verenafusp alfa 9 mg/kg intravenously'], 'otherNames': ['verenafusp alfa', 'GNR-055']}, {'type': 'BIOLOGICAL', 'name': 'Cohort 3: 12 mg/kg', 'description': 'Single intravenous administration of 12 mg/kg of verenafusp alfa', 'armGroupLabels': ['verenafusp alfa 12 mg/kg intravenously'], 'otherNames': ['verenafusp alfa', 'GNR-055']}]","[{'measure': 'Proportion of participants with Adverse Events', 'description': 'Adverse events, Laboratory tests, Vital signs, Physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, Allergic reactions, Infusion reactions, Antidrug antibody', 'timeFrame': 'Day 28'}]","Inclusion Criteria:

NCT06472154,COMPLETED,2023-01-01,2023-12-31,"Depression and anxiety among the older adults is an issue that cannot be ignored at present. Compared to traditional pharmacological treatments and electroconvulsive therapy, non pharmacological treatments with fewer side effects, such as music-based intervention, are also effective and more easily accepted for the treatment of depression and anxiety in the older adults. In China, there have been some researches conducted Chinese five elements music as a clinical treatment for relieving depression and anxiety disorders in patients. However, there is few research on the impact of Chinese five elements music-based intervention based on midnight-noon ebb-flow theory on depression and anxiety in the older adults. This study investigated the intervention effect of Chinese five elements music-based intervention accompanied by midnight-noon ebb-flow theory on depression and anxiety in older adults. This study intervened in music-based intervention for 86 older adults with depression and anxiety, and divided the 86 subjects into an experimental group (with Chinese five elements music based on midnight-noon ebb-flow theory) and a control group (with Chinese five elements music). This study used the Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire as assessment instruments after the intervention.

NCT06474624,COMPLETED,2023-05-26,2024-05-01,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries, accounting for approximately one-third of all deaths in individuals over 35 years of age.

Despite research to date, the basis of the disease is still poorly understood, with chronic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system being proposed as such a basis, as well as pathophysiological and pathogenic approaches. Hypertension has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and dyslipidaemia and is directly linked to mortality caused by coronary artery disease.

Moderate Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) has been recognised as the gold standard for many years. However, for some time, different researchers have adopted the high-intensity interval training model (HIIT) as the most effective method in terms of objective adaptations of most cardiac rehabilitation programmes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of cycles between warm-up and cool-down periods, high-intensity exercise intensity followed by an active recovery period. The duration and intensity of these cycles vary between studies and there is no consensus on which is the optimal cycle. In general, the high-intensity exercise phase is applied at 80-100% of VO2 max and the active recovery phase is used between 50-70% of VO2 max.

In Moderate Intensity Continuous Training the submaximal exercise intensity determined in accordance with the patient's functional capacity between the warm-up and cool-down periods is applied for a fixed period. The Moderate Intensity Continuous Training is planned to consist of 20-30 minute sessions between 50-70% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max).","['Coronary Heart Disease', 'Quality of Life', 'Functional Capacity', 'Fatigue']",INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],78,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,"[{'type': 'OTHER', 'name': 'Cardio Rehabilitation program', 'description': 'A total of 24 30 (8-10 weeks) sessions of an exercise-based Cardio Rehabilitation program 3 days a week.', 'armGroupLabels': ['High-intensity interval training', 'Moderate Intensity Continuous Training']}, {'type': 'OTHER', 'name': 'Cycling for 20-30 minutes', 'description': 'Cycling for 20-30 minutes at 50-70% of Wmax between warm-up and cool-down periods.', 'armGroupLabels': ['Moderate Intensity Continuous Training']}, {'type': 'OTHER', 'name': 'Cycling a total of 4 cycles', 'description': 'Cycling a total of 4 cycles consisting of 4 minutes at 85-100% of Wmax followed by 3 minutes of active recovery periods at 50-70% of Wmax between warm-up and cool-down periods.', 'armGroupLabels': ['High-intensity interval training']}]","[{'measure': 'Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) - Heart Rate Recovery', 'description': 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is performed on patients with a bicycle ergometer, including analysis of exhaled gases.

All patients were divided into a mindfulness group (n=30) who received a four-week mindfulness training program and a control group (n=30) who received only one mindfulness lecture over four weeks. No age difference was found between the mindfulness group (M=53.87, SD=10.31, ranging from 35 to 75) and the control group (M=52.73, SD=7.27, ranging from 42 to 69), t(58) =0.49, p=0.625. The participants were all women and none of them reported a history of neurological or psychiatric illness.

Ethics approval statement All procedures involving human participants in this study were conducted in strict accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethical Committee at a medical university, as well as the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments, or any comparable ethical standards. All participants gave informed consent before participating. Furthermore, following the completion of the study, the control group could also undergo the same mindfulness training program if they volunteered.

Measurements Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. It contains 15 items in a single dimension. All of the items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (""strongly agree"") to 7 (""strongly disagree""). Higher scores reflect a higher level of trait mindfulness and awareness of the present moment. The Cronbach\&#39;s α was 0.89 and the two-week test-retest reliability was 0.87 in the Chinese sample. The Cronbach\&#39;s α coefficient of the scale in the present study was 0.87.

The Patient Health Questionnaire. Its depression subscale consists of 9 items. All of the items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (""strongly disagree"") to 4 (""strongly agree""). Higher scores indicate a greater level of depression. The Cronbach\&#39;s α was 0.86 and the two-week test-retest reliability was 0.86 in the Chinese sample. The Cronbach\&#39;s α coefficient of the scale in the present study was 0.87.

The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. It consists of 36 items and nine subscales. These subscales assess various strategies employed in cognitive emotion regulation, such as self-blame, blaming others, acceptance, refocus on planning, positive refocusing, rumination or focus on thought, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, and catastrophizing. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\&#34;strongly disagree\&#34;) to 5 (\&#34;strongly agree\&#34;). Higher scores on each subscale indicate a greater likelihood of utilizing that particular cognitive emotion regulation strategy in the face of negative events. Adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategy is assessed using the sum of scores on the acceptance, putting into perspective, refocus on planning, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal subscales. Non-adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategy is assessed using the sum of scores on the self-blame, blaming others, rumination or focus on thought, and catastrophizing subscales. In the Chinese samples, the Cronbach\&#39;s α coefficients for these subscales ranged from 0.48 to 0.89. The Cronbach\&#39;s α coefficients of the adaptive and non-adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies subscales in the present study were 0.84 and 0.74 respectively.

The Positive and Negative Affect Scale. It contains 20 items and consists of two self-report subscales including positive emotions and negative emotions. All of the items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (""strongly disagree"") to 5 (""strongly agree""). The higher the score, the stronger the emotions in a certain dimension. The Cronbach\&#39;s α for positive and negative emotions were 0.85 and 0.83 respectively in the Chinese sample. The Cronbach\&#39;s α coefficients of the positive and negative emotions subscales in the present study were 0.84 and 0.78 respectively.

Procedure There are three phases in the present study, i.e., the pre-training test phase (T1), the training phase, and the post-training test phase (T2). In the two test phases, all participants completed all the questionnaires including the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-depression subscale, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Positive and Negative Affect Scales.

The mindfulness training program consisted of four 45-minute lessons, conducted once a week. After each lesson, participants were required to complete daily homework, which included the mindfulness exercises learned during that week for at least 30 minutes. The control group only attended a mindfulness lecture during the four weeks.

The mindfulness training program was based on Kabat-Zinn\&#39;s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction5 and Williams\&#39; Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy. Additionally, specific contents of cancer-related mindfulness training were incorporated into this program, such as Anti-cancer Self-healing Power: 8 Lessons in Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction. The contents of the mindfulness training program included:

Session 1: Establishing a connection with the body. Mindfulness activities consisted of eating one raisin mindfully and mindfulness cobble practice.

Session 2: Observing thoughts as they are. Mindfulness activities included the body scan and awareness of breathing meditation.

Session 3: Cultivating mindful attention. Mindfulness activities involved awareness of breathing meditation and mindfulness compassion meditation.

Session 4: Applying mindfulness in daily life. Mindfulness activities included embracing yourself, 3-min breathing space and mindfulness stretching exercises.

Statistical analysis To investigate the impact of mindfulness training on mental states, we conducted a 2 (Group: mindfulness group and control group) × 2 (Test time: T1 and T2) repeated measures ANOVA on each scale score. If a significant interaction effect or main effect was observed, post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction was performed. To examine the role of cognitive emotion regulation strategy in improving emotional symptoms, we constructed multiple mediation models based on previous studies. First, we calculated the improvements in all measurements by subtracting the scores at T1 from the scores at T2 (i.e., improvement=T2-T1). Next, we examined bivariate correlations between each two improvements. Finally, we treated mindfulness training (0=control group, 1=training group) as the independent variable, the improvement in depressive symptoms as the dependent variable, and the improvements in cognitive emotion regulation strategy and positive/negative emotions as the mediators.

NCT06480409,COMPLETED,2023-06-05,2024-06-05,"Project Objective and Scope:

The COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020, significantly altered social structures globally. In Poland, the pandemic led to prolonged periods of physical isolation and remote learning for students, disrupting conventional educational routines and causing elevated levels of loneliness and mental health issues, particularly depression. Research indicates that 30% of students exhibited symptoms of depression, and 50% experienced heightened stress during the pandemic. This project aims to address these mental health challenges by implementing a virtual reality (VR)-based therapeutic program for students at Opole University of Technology.

Project Description:

The proposed project focuses on using immersive VR technology to conduct relaxation sessions for students. The initiative will create a relaxation room equipped with VR headsets and physiological sensors to monitor students' responses during VR sessions. The primary goal is to evaluate the impact of VR-based relaxation therapy on the autonomic nervous system and psychological well-being of students.

Specific Objectives:

Implementing VR in Medical Practice:

VR technology has proven effective in various medical fields, including surgery, rehabilitation, and mental health. This project will leverage immersive VR to create an engaging and effective therapeutic environment. The therapy sessions will be conducted using portable VR headsets, providing students with an immersive experience that isolates them from real-world stressors.

Scientific Analysis:

Physiological data will be collected using Polar H-10 sensors to assess heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic nervous system activity. This data will help determine the effectiveness of different VR scenarios in inducing relaxation and improving mental well-being. The project will also monitor psychological changes using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10).

Methodology:

A sample size of 50 participants has been calculated based on previous studies using G\*Power software.

NCT06478914,COMPLETED,2022-02-01,2023-01-01,"Burned patients experience various problems, including skin damage, vascular damage, and metabolic stress. These injuries can lead to peripheral neuropathies, which can affect nerve function and cause weakness or lack of sensation. Lymphatic damage can delay wound healing, causing contractures that affect the patient's physical function. Burn-Associated polyneuropathy (BAPN) is common after thermal injury, affecting nerve function. Electrophysiological assessments of muscle and nerves are essential in neurology, physical therapy, and related clinical disciplines. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is used to increase force output, strengthen muscles, and control pain. Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) is used to treat chronic inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, improving absorption of fluid, secretion of macrophage growth factors, DNA synthesis, pain reduction, and electron respiratory chain reaction. However, the effect of LILT on scar formation and treatment of fibrosis or calcification secondary to hematomas or fat necrosis is not yet evaluated.

The need for this study developed from the lack of quantitative knowledge and information in the published studies about the application of both NMES and LIL to improve the neuropathic common peroneal nerve postburn.

The significance of this study arises from the rarity of information about the effectiveness of both NMES and LIL on the neuropathic common peroneal nerve post-burn, as well as the precise dosage and frequency of treatment required to promote improvement of the neuropathic common peroneal nerve post burn.","['Neuropathy, Peroneal', 'Motor Neuropathy', 'Neuromuscular Electric Stimulation (NEMS)', 'Low Intensity Laser']",INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],60,TREATMENT,"[{'type': 'DEVICE', 'name': 'Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)', 'description': ""NMES unit manufactured by Enraf-Holland was be used to administer the neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) The study involved adjusting the patient's hips, knees, and ankles to achieve a comfortable position.

NCT06479733,COMPLETED,2023-06-01,2024-06-22,"Soft tissue grafting around dental implants has been recommended to enhance functional, biological, and esthetic outcomes. As a thick peri-implant mucosa is of importance to prevent recession, color alterations, bone remodeling and promote ""creeping attachment"". Two major indications include the increase of the KM width and the increase of soft tissue volume using autogenous or alternative type grafts.

Several techniques have been proposed to augment the volume of the mucosa to achieve the so-called pink esthetics: connective tissue grafts, lyophilized allogenic soft tissue grafts, porcine collagen matrix, free gingival grafts, a combination of grafting and vestibuloplasty, strip gingival autografts, tissue engineered fibroblasts, allograft, collagen matrices, and the use of the buccal pedicle flap.

Among surgical techniques, the proposed modified buccal pedicle flap was demonstrated to perform well in terms of decreased morbidity, maintenance of blood supply, stabilization of the pedicle, superior haemostasis, and speed of treatment. However, a possible drawback may be related to the original thickness of the flap since a thin mucosa phenotype may be more prompt to perforation when in contact with a cross-linked collagen matrix.

The autologous subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is generally regarded as the gold standard for soft tissue augmentation around natural teeth and dental implants. However, harvesting an autologous soft tissue graft necessarily entails additional preoperative preparation, a second surgical site, longer operative duration, and increased morbidity, regardless of the surgical technique employed and the expertise of the operator.

Another alternative for autogenous grafting is the acellular dermal matrix (ADM) allograft that is derived from human skin. ADM, originally used for treating burn wounds , is an epithelium free, freeze-dried matrix containing types I and III collagen bundles where elastic fibers are its main components . ADM acts as a bioactive scaffold that integrates in host tissue and permits the migration of fibroblasts and epithelial and endothelial cells through vascular channels of the recipient sites . Since its initial use, ADM has been widely used in dental practice, in particular for soft tissue grafting of gingival recession or to change the quality of peri-implant/teeth mucosa.",['Soft Tissue Augmentation Around Dental Implants'],INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],28,TREATMENT,"[{'type': 'PROCEDURE', 'name': 'buccal pedicle flap', 'description': 'For the first group (buccal pedicle flap group), outlining the full-thickness palatal flap 1 mm greater than the diameter of the underlying cover screw will be done, making a partial incision at the hinge portion of the created mini-pedicle flap to facilitate buccal rolling, de-epithelializing the mini-pedicle flap, then two small vertical incisions will be performed similarly mesial and distal to the screw border as wide as possible preserving the papilla and extending labially to include all the keratinized mucosa, elevating a full-thickness flap, then rolling of the pedicle flap into the created buccal pouch.

NCT06470724,COMPLETED,2021-10-04,2022-05-01,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a brain development disorder marked by issues in two main areas: communication and interacting with others; as well as rigid, repetitive, and stereotypical behaviors, hobbies, or activities. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is becoming more common every year, making it a major concern for most parents around the world, including those in Indonesia. One of the areas in Indonesia, Yogyakarta, also has to deal with this problem.

Studies have shown that a lot of kids with autism are afraid of things that don't make sense. Sensory issues are common in kids with ASD, which makes it hard for them to handle the sounds and sights in the dentist's office. As a result, these kids often show more behavioral problems, too much worry, and bad behavior at the dentist's office, which makes it very hard for the dentists to do exams and provide oral care. Researchers also think that this refusal to cooperate makes parents hesitant to take their autistic children to the dentist for regular checkups or treatments. This means that these kids don't get the dental care they need and have bad mouth health. Also, many studies show that kids with ASD are more likely than kids in the general population to have cavities, bad oral health, and periodontal disease.

To help people with behavior problems, you need to know about their other health problems, the type of ASD they have, any previous treatment they've had, their behavior, their social and communication skills, the medicines they take to control their behavior, any learning disabilities or mental retardation they may have, their heightened sensory perceptions, and their inability to apply what they have learned in other situations.

Notably, visual pedagogy is a structural-visual behavior method that is often used with kids who have ASD. People in Indonesia have looked into how to help kids with autism understand dental checks by using visual aids. However, these tests were not done in real centers with lots of kids and long wait times. With this and other reasons in mind, this study used a visual-structural method to help Indonesian kids with autism during dental checks. What they learned about kids and their families led them to make changes. The information can help dentists handle kids with ASD and guess how they will act during dental exams.

The intervention comprised seven behavior approaches in this research defined as follows:

A successive approach: An approach to familiarization with the unfamiliar environment of the simulated dental office.

Tell-Feel-Show-Do (T-F-S-D): A dental approach explained to the patient's treatment by telling the patient what would happen, what he felt or did, and what had been done.

Visual pedagogy: Introduced dentistry to autistic children through visual media, such as pictures and photographs.

Audiovisual modeling: A learning process through audiovisual media, such as video and animation.

In-vivo modeling: Learning new activities by watching them in front of the model.

NCT06478966,COMPLETED,2024-04-30,2024-05-15,"Introduction Stoma surgery may be required in the treatment of some digestive and urological diseases to enable the passage of stool and urine and accelerate wound healing. In the USA, an estimated 750,000 to 1 million people are living with a stoma and approximately 100,000 stoma surgeries are performed annually.Nurses play a crucial role in the complication management, care, and education of individuals who have or are planned to have a stoma. According to the International Ostomy Guideline, bothnursing students and clinical nurses hadlacked experience providing stoma care and had insufficient knowledge about stoma care. Similarly, Zimnicki and Pieper (2018) reported that nursing students had a low level of knowledge about stoma care and lacked confidence in their ability to care for a patient with stoma.

Stoma patient care and developing stoma care skills are included in the curriculum of nursing programs. Nursing students are taught stoma care skills through theoretical explanation, psychomotor skill training, demonstration, use of skills, and practice. Ensuring that nursing students attain stoma care competency can help reduce their anxiety by increasing their self-confidence when they start working as clinical nurses. Therefore, effective training and development of stoma care skills is important during undergraduate education.

There are few interventional studies using different teaching methods to improve nursing students' stoma care knowledge and skills. The teaching methods used in these studies included a serious game-based web application, a 2-hour interactive session followed by 24-hour ostomy appliance wear, and web-assisted learning and peer learning interventions. Utilizing different teaching methods was found to improve the stoma care knowledge and skills of nursing students. For this reason, it is important for nurse educators to incorporate diverse and innovative learning methods into their teaching methodologies.

The mission of educational institutions is to use creative tools to improve the educational process and enhance learning outcomes. One of the tools most frequently used in education is the PowerPoint presentation. PowerPoint is a slideshow software that supports multiple intelligences in the learning process and increases student interest, motivation, and learning, leading to greater self-efficacy and more positive attitudes towards the educational experience. Another advantage is that it can be easily accessed by everyone.

The PechaKucha (PK) method is a visual and narrative slide-based presentation technique. It involves a 20-slide presentation format in which each slide is shown for 20 seconds and the entire presentation lasts 6 minutes and 40 seconds. The PK method uses images and minimal text on each slide, which allows the presenter to convey information to the audience quickly and concisely. The concise and visual nature of the presentation results in more active listening by the audience. The concept of PK was first developed by Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein in 2003. The term PK is derived from the Japanese word meaning ""chit chat"" and represents the effective presentation of information.

This presentation method can also be utilized as an innovative teaching technique in nursing education. Students have reported that lessons conducted using the PK method were more fun, interesting, liberating, and creative, and the short duration also increased student satisfaction. In nursing education, the use of PK has been studied in areas such as knee prosthesis and nursing approaches, physiopathology education, and the development of presentation skills. However, there is no study in the literature evaluating the effect of the PK method in stoma care education for nursing students. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of stoma care training delivered using the PK method on stoma care skills and anxiety in nursing students.

Research questions

1. Does stoma care training delivered using the PK method effectively improve the stoma care skills of nursing students?
2. Does stoma care training delivered using the PK method effectively reduce state anxiety of nursing students? Methods Design A single-blind randomized controlled study was conducted according to the CONSORT guideline.

Research setting The study was carried out in the nursing department of the health sciences faculty of a university in the spring semester of the 2023-2024 academic year. Data were collected from first-year nursing students taking the basic principles and practices of nursing course. This course for first-year students consists of 4 hours of theoretical and 12 hours of practical education. The subject matter is taught in the theoretical component of the course, while in the practical component, this theoretical knowledge is reinforced by methods such as video demonstration and working on a model in the technical skills laborotory Participants The population of the study consisted of 115 first-year students who took the basic principles and practices of nursing course in the spring semester of the 2023-2024 academic year. The sample consisted of 96 students (47 in the intervention group and 49 controls) who met the sampling criteria.

Inclusion criteria were: being a first-year student, attending the specified course, agreeing to participate in the study, and participating in the stoma care training.

Exclusion criteria were: not attending class and not participating in the stoma care practice and evaluation process after stoma care training. Students who met the sampling criteria were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups using a randomization program. The OpenEpi program was used to calculate the sample size based on the population. With a 50% observation rate, 5% standard deviation, and 99% power range, the sample calculation indicated that 96 students were needed in the study sample. At the end of the study, the data obtained were used to recalculate the power of the study in G\*Power version 3.1. With the sample size of 96, effect size of 1.89, and p=0.05, the power of the study was found to be 1.00.

Data Collection Tools The data were collected between April 30 and May 3, 2024 using a student information form, the Stoma Care Skill Rubric, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.

Student Information Form This form included the age and gender of the student. Stoma Care Skill Rubric This 23-item scale was developed by İncesu and Ulupınar (2022). They reported the content validity index of the scale to be 0.91. In reliability analysis, the mean Kappa score of agreement between two observers was 0.84 (p=0.001) and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.98. In the test-retest analysis, it was observed that scores increased significantly in the second assessment (p\<0.05). It is a valid and reliable measurement tool with scores ranging from 0 to 46. In our study, the Cronbach's alpha value was found to be 0.85.

2.4.3. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory This scale, consisting of 40 items total with 20 in each of 2 subscales, was developed by Spielberg et al. in 1964 to measure state and trait anxiety levels and translated into Turkish by Le-Comple and Öner in 1983.

The State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) indicates how you feel in certain circumstances and at a certain moment, described in 20 statements of feelings and behaviors. The Turkish translation of the SAI was reported to have Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients of 0.94-0.96 and item reliability correlations of 0.42-0.85. Test-retest reliability rates were found to be between 0.26 and 0.68.

The Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) evaluates how a person generally feels. The Turkish version of the TAI was found to have a Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients of 0.83-0.87, item reliability correlations of 0.34-0.72, and test-retest reliability rates of 0.71-0.86. The inventory is a valid and reliable scale.

Study Procedures Control Group: We first brought the control group into the classroom and announced that a study would be conducted on stoma care skills. Students who volunteered to participate in the study were asked to fill in the student information form and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After these data were collected, the group received a classical lecture presentation on stoma care. The lesson lasted about 30 minutes. After the lecture presentation, practical stoma care was demonstrated to the entire class by applying a stoma model to a volunteer student. This part took about 10 minutes. Finally, we answered the students' questions. After the education was completed, the students were taken to the skills laboratory and divided into 3 groups to work with low-fidelity models. Each group was headed by one of the researchers, who guided the students and completed the training. Two days after the training, the students were invited back to the technical skills laboratory and the SAI was administered again. Then, each student was taken to the room individually and asked to perform stoma care on the low-fidelity model. During this practice, one of the researchers observed the student and applied the Stoma Care Skill Rubric.

Intervention Group:After the control group training was completed, we brought the intervention group into the classroom and recruited participants and administered the student information form and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory as described above. After data collection, the group received stoma care training delivered using the PK method. The presentation consisted of 20 slides, each shown for 20 seconds, for a total presentation length of about 7 minutes. After the PK presentation, the practical stoma care demonstration, question-and-answer, and group practice with low-fidelity models were done as described above. Students in the intervention group were also assessed individually using the Stoma Care Skill Rubric in the technical skills laboratory and completed the SAI again two days after the training.

Data Analysis The data obtained in the study were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Skewness and kurtosis values were examined to assess normality and the results indicated that the data showed normal distribution. Baseline data were summarized as number, percentage, mean, and standard deviation and were compared between the groups using chi-square and independent-samples t-test.

NCT06478771,COMPLETED,2021-12-14,2024-06-12,"This study investigates whether allowing patients to choose the type of retainer-fixed or removable-affects the success of orthodontic retention in terms of stability and patient satisfaction. The hypothesis is that patient autonomy in selecting their retainer type can enhance retention success. Conducted as a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial, the study involves patients who have completed fixed appliance treatment. Participants are randomly assigned to either the intervention group, where they choose their retainer type after being informed of the pros and cons, or the control group, where the clinician decides the retainer type.

The primary outcome of the study is the stability of the orthodontic treatment, with secondary outcomes including retainer survival, oral health, and patient satisfaction. Stability is measured using indices such as Little's irregularity index, inter-canine width, and overjet, among others. Oral health is evaluated based on caries presence, sulcus depth, and gingival bleeding. Retainer survival is monitored by incidents of losing or breaking the retainer. Patient satisfaction is assessed through a detailed questionnaire covering aspects such as retainer usage, comfort, and perceived value. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding is not possible for operators, participants, or assessors. This study aims to provide insights into how patient choice influences the outcomes of orthodontic retention, potentially guiding future clinical practices towards enhanced patient satisfaction and treatment success.

This study aims to provide valuable insights into the impact of patient autonomy on orthodontic retention outcomes.

NCT06481657,COMPLETED,2022-02-10,2023-08-20,"The study population: The study recruited 24 patients with heart failure who came to the cardiac rehabilitation program at Laniado Hospital who met the inclusion criteria. After receiving an explanation of the study, the participants were asked to sign an informed consent form and were randomly divided into 2 training groups, with and without oxygen administration. A sample, using G-power software, medium effect size (0.3), power 0.8 and an error of 0.05 was found to be equal to 24 participants.

Measurement and evaluation tool:

Maximum effort protocol: to assess the maximum aerobic capacity, a graded exercise test was performed on a moving track according to the Bruce protocol. which began by walking at 2.4 km/h and a 10% incline, every three minutes the incline and speed were increased until the subject reported that he/she could not continue any longer. At the end of each step the heart rate was recorded Heart rate and the subjective degree of difficulty according to the Borg scale. The last stage reached by the subject was used to determine multiple values (calculated heart rate and maximum oxygen consumption).

Aerobic submaximal exercise protocol: the test consisted of walking on a track at an incline and speed determined according to the phase corresponding to the Bruce protocol in which the patient reached 80% of the maximum heart rate at the beginning of the training program, the participant was asked to persist in walking until he could not continue at the required pace and reached fatigue. Record the time and distance until the end of the effort.

A submaximal exercise protocol to compare single exercise conditions with and without oxygen: In order to compare the effect of supplementing oxygen in a single exercise some of the participants (n=20) performed a submaximal exercise protocol with and without oxygen in two consecutive sessions and in random order. The tests were performed on a rail at an incline and speed determined according to the phase corresponding to the Bruce protocol in which the patient reached 80% of the heart rate. In the test under oxygen conditions, oxygen supplementation of \~20% (5 liters per minute) was given using oxygen goggles, and in the test under conditions without oxygen supplementation (placebo) room air was given (5 liters per minute) using oxygen goggles. Every three minutes, the heart rate was recorded, the feeling of exertion and the level of lactic acid in the blood, the time and distance that the participants gulped until they reported that they could not continue with the given effort was recorded. The tests were done within 72 hours and in random order.

Calculation of metabolic expenditure (METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task): one METs defines the amount of oxygen consumption at rest, sitting in a chair, and is equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen per kilogram of body per minute, METs during the training program in effort on a track is calculated according to speed and gradient according to The following formula: METs=(0.1Xspeed+1.8XspeedXgrade+3.5)/3.5 Metabolic expenditure in the maximal effort protocol was calculated for each minute during the Bruce protocol.

Borg scale: a reliable and valid subjective tool for assessing difficulty when performing an effort, where a rating of 6 indicates no effort at all, while a score of 20 indicates maximum effort The level of lactic acid in the blood: measured using Lactate Scout+, . Lactic acid levels were measured before the start of the test while resting on a chair and with effort every 3 minutes and at the end of the test.

Calculation of target heart rate in training according to the Karbonan formula: target heart rate at the beginning of training is calculated as 50% of the heart rate reserve according to the following formula: resting heart rate\] + 50% percentage of maximum capacity X (maximum heart rate - resting heart rate)\].

Functional test for assessing walking ability: (6MWT) Six Minute Walk Test: a clinical test used to assess aerobic capacity, which is found to be reliable and valid for assessing the functional status of heart failure patients. The test includes a six-minute walk where the instruction is given to walk the maximum distance that can be achieved in six minutes..

Questionnaire to assess quality of life in heart failure patients The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ): This questionnaire was found to be valid, reliable and sensitive to quality of life in heart failure patients. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, where a higher score indicates a higher quality of life. The sections of each question are divided by a hundred (according to the number of possible answers in each section), when you can get a maximum of one hundred points for each question. The overall score is an average of all sections.

A score below 45 indicates a poor quality of life. An improvement in the overall score of 5 points indicates a slight improvement, an improvement of 10 points indicates a moderate improvement, and an improvement of 20 points indicates a great improvement in the quality of life. In addition, an improvement in the overall score of 5 points indicates a reduction of approximately 7% in the risk of death or hospitalization. And every 10-point improvement indicates a 14% reduction in the risk of death or hospitalization.Disease severity index - New York Heart Association - NYHA: a valid and accepted index for assessing the severity of the disease based on symptoms of shortness of breath Power throughout the training program: during the training program, the speed and incline that the participants walked on the treadmill were measured at 4 time points and the METs were calculated according to the following formula: METs=(0.1Xspeed+1.8XspeedXgrade+3.5)/3.5.

The strength of the training in resistance exercises: in the second month of the training, 2 resistance exercises were combined for the patients One for the upper limbs and one for the lower limbs for the exerciser's choice, the weight was adjusted at which the participant was able to perform 15 repetitions while reporting a degree of difficulty of 15 ""hard effort"" on the Borg scale (RPE-15).

5.4. Research Process Upon admission of the patients to the Balneado Cardiac Rehabilitation Center, a cardiologist's assessment was performed to check inclusion criteria and release them to the study. At this stage, the doctor or physiotherapist made an appeal to those who met the inclusion criteria to participate in the study. After a detailed explanation of the study and its requirements, those interested in participating were asked to give their consent in writing and were given Randomized to one of two groups (with oxygen, and a control group). Both groups trained with oxygen goggles during all aerobic efforts throughout the training program, the O2 group trained with oxygen supplementation of 5 L/min and the control group trained without oxygen enrichment with air flow room (placebo).

In the first week upon admission to rehabilitation, the patients underwent a graded exercise test until fatigue according to the Bruce protocol. At the end of each step of the protocol, heart rate data was collected from the heart rate monitor and the level of difficulty according to a report. 50% of the heart rate reserve according to the maximum heart rate reached by the patient in the graded exercise test. In this session, the participants filled out the Kansas Quality of Life Questionnaire, the severity of the disease was rated according to the NYHA rating, and a six-minute walk test was performed.

In the second week, the patients in both groups performed 2 submaximal tests on a track at a speed and gradient corresponding to the stage at which they reached 80% of the maximum heart rate in the maximum test. This test was done with oxygen goggles with added oxygen and without it (placebo) (in random order) with a difference of 72 hours between the tests. Heart rate, RPE and lactic acid concentration were sampled in all the trainees until the end of the test.

During the training program, which lasted 8 weeks and included two sessions per week, one hour each, the participants exercised according to the target heart rate determined by the physiologist, at RPE 13. Throughout the training program, if the patient reported an RPE lower than 12 for the target heart rate given to him The target heart rate was increased according to the heart rate reserve by 5%.

The course of the training in the first month included: five minutes of warm-up, then 20 minutes of walking on a track, 15 minutes of cycling, ten minutes of aerobic equipment of each participant's choice and finally five minutes of active recovery. In the second month after walking and cycling, two strength exercises were combined: one for lower limbs and one for upper limbs according to the exerciser's choice, for each exercise 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions were performed at a hard effort level (RPE-15). The intensity of effort in each training session was recorded for each participant. At the end of the program, after 8 weeks, an additional assessment of maximal aerobic capacity was performed using a maximal graded exercise test, a continuous submaximal test until fatigue according to the stage in the Bruce protocol that the patient performed at the beginning of the program. These two tests were performed for both groups without oxygen supplementation. In addition, the participants were asked to fill out a Kansas Quality of Life questionnaire and perform a six-minute walk test.

5.5. Data Analysis Descriptive statistics were performed to describe the study population for demographic, anthropometric variables, disease characteristics, years of illness and NYHA score, functional indices and quality of life questionnaire score. All variables were tested for normal distribution by the Smirnoff Kolmogorov test. Variables that were not normally distributed were monotonically transformed and retested for normal distribution. Variables found to be normal were reported as mean and standard deviation and variables not normally distributed (NYHA) were reported as median and quartiles.

In order to test the differences between the 2 groups in the outcome measures (maximum power in a maximal effort test, time and distance in a submaximal test, a six-minute walk test and a quality of life questionnaire score) a 2 way ANOVA mixed model repeated measures analysis model was used to find a central effect of group (O2 , control), time (before and after training), and the interaction between them (time x group) if the interaction was found to be significant, a simple mean analysis was performed to check the source of the difference.

For the NYHA score (an ordinal variable) the PROC GENMODE procedure was used, which allowed the use of a 2 way ANOVA model. To find the difference in the severity of the disease in the two groups before and after the training program.

In testing the difference between the groups in training power (according to METs) at 4 different times in the weeks (W) of the training program (W1, W3, W6, W8), a Bonferroni type post hoc analysis was conducted to test the source of the differences.

In order to test the differences between performing a single submaximal exercise test with and without oxygen supplementation of each participant (within) in measures of the feeling of exertion (RPE), heart rate and lactic acid levels at each stage, the slope was calculated throughout the time each test lasted. A smaller slope indicates a more moderate increase in the tested variable over time, and expresses better aerobic capacity at submaximal power. Differences in slopes between performing a submaximal test with and without oxygen were tested by the signed rank test Data analysis was done using SAS software version 9.4. p\< 0.05 was set as money for statistical significance.","['Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction', 'Heart Failure With Mid Range Ejection Fraction']",INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],24,OTHER,"[{'type': 'OTHER', 'name': 'train with oxygen and without oxygen enrichment (placebo).', 'description': 'The experimental group will train with oxygen goggles in the aerobic part of the training The control group will train with oxygen goggles without oxygen enrichment (placebo).', 'armGroupLabels': ['The control group will train with oxygen goggles without oxygen enrichment (placebo).', 'The experimental group will train with oxygen goggles in the aerobic part of the training']}]","[{'measure': 'maximall aerobic training indices', 'description': 'Maximum aerobic power will be tested before the start of the training program and immediately thereafter by a maximum rated stress test according to Proctol Bruce', 'timeFrame': 'the test will be tested before the start of the training program and immediately thereafter'}, {'measure': 'submaximal aerobic training indices', 'description': 'Sub-maximal aerobic exertion: The assessment will include walking to fatigue on a sloping track and speed according to the Bruce Proctol phase where the patient was at 80% of the maximum heart rate in a pre-workout rated stress test.', 'timeFrame': 'the test will be tested before the start of the training program and immediately thereafter'}, {'measure': 'aerobic training indices', 'description': 'six minute walk test', 'timeFrame': 'the test will be tested before the start of the training program and immediately thereafter'}, {'measure': 'Quality of life and disease severity', 'description': 'Quality of life will be measured using The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire', 'timeFrame': 'the test will be tested before the start of the training program and immediately thereafter'}, {'measure': 'disease severity', 'description': 'New York Heart Association-NYHA - A measure of the severity of the disease that includes 4 different levels: Level 1, which represents a condition in which there is impaired heart function but the patient is short of breath when performing level 4 exercise, when the patient is unable to exercise without shortness of breath.

Patients in this study will be selected from the outpatient clinic of Oral Medicine and Periodontology department, Faculty of Dentistry, Mansoura University.

Patients participating in this study will sign an informed consent demonstrating the purpose of this study, treatment procedure, probable risks and benefits from this treatment procedure. The study proposal will be reviewed by the faculty's Research Ethics Committee.

All the selected patients will receive full mouth scaling, preoperative periapical x-ray and cone beam computed.

Surgical procedures:

Before surgery, Preoperative antibiotics will be given orally one hour prior to surgery (amoxicillin, 2g, or clindamycin, 600 mg, for patients allergic to penicillin) the patients will be advised to rinse for one minute with chlorhexidiene mouthwash. After local anesthesia administration, In group 1, the teeth will be extracted gently using periotomes, in an attempt to preserve facial and lingual bone plates. The sockets will be debrided of soft tissue and irrigated. Then all walls of the socket will be inspected and checked for the presence of fenestration or dehiscence defects in bone. The length and width of extracted roots will be measured to determine the length and diameter of implants placed. The osteotomy sites will be prepared and the drills will be used in proper sequence according to manufacturer's instructions, with maximum use of bone apical to the extraction sockets. The drills will extend 3 to 5 mm beyond the apex of the socket to ensure primary stability after placement, taking care of the anatomical boundaries. After the osteotomy sites had been prepared, the implants will be placed.

In group 2, concerning the donor site of the connective tissue, connective tissue graft was harvested from palate using trap door technique (27) utilizing a horizontal incision 3-4 mm away from the gingival margin with two vertical incisions on the either end of the first incision, creating a door, the door is then undermined and opened using a sharp dissection, the underlying connective tissue is then harvested using a periosteal elevator, and the door was then sutured using 4 0 silk sutures Finally, the connective tissue graft was immediately placed into the recipient site after a tunneling procedure and sutured with 6-0 nonresorbable monofilament sutures.

In group 3, the crown of the involved tooth will be removed and the root will be then sectioned in a mesiodistal direction along its long axis as far apical as was possible using a long shank fissure bur coupled to a hydrated high-speed handpiece. Sectioning will divide the tooth root into facial and palatal halves with the intention of preserving the facial root section unmanipulated and attached to the tooth socket. Periotomes will be then inserted between the palatal root section and the alveolar socket wall to sever the PDL and this section of root will be then carefully delivered with so as not to disturb the facial root section.

The remaining root section will be then reduced coronally to 1 mm above the alveolar crest, and will be thinned slightly to a concave contour by careful application in an apico-coronal and mesiodistal direction with a long shanked round diamond. The tooth socket's palatal wall and apex will be then curetted to remove any tissue or infective remnants and the root section will be checked for immobility with a sharp probe. With the preparation steps complete, the tooth root hereafter will be known as the socket-shield. An osteotomy will be then sequentially prepared and internal conical connection implant was inserted palatal to the socket shield with the implant 2 mm below the facial crest.

NCT06476522,COMPLETED,2019-10-01,2020-05-01,"Background:

Colon cancer (CC) is the third most diagnosed type of cancer worldwide. The age of onset varies between 50-75 years . Control of risk factors and early detection and its precursors through screening have an important role in reducing the incidence and mortality of CC. This means that the number of people living with and undergoing treatment for CC is growing.

One of the common treatment of CC is chemotherapy. It is known that chemotherapy can cause severe adverse effects that can be highly detrimental to a patient both physiologically and psychologically, thus having a large impact on an individual's quality of life (QoL). The most common and severe of these adverse effects are peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue . In addition, liver and kidney dysfunctions are seen in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Depending on the chemotherapy-related toxicity, side effects such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occur in patients. For this reason, regular blood tests of the patients during the chemotherapy process and their blood values were followed.

Studies examining the effect of exercise on the side effects of chemotherapy in colon and rectal cancer have found strong evidence for short-term improvements. There are various studies investigating the effects of exercises performed during chemotherapy on QoL, fatigue, and aerobic capacity in patients with CC. However, the duration and content of exercise programs in these studies are quite limited. No study was examined the effects of a home-based physiotherapy and recommendation program during 12-weeks chemotherapy treatment.

NCT06472648,COMPLETED,2019-11-18,2020-02-21,"Sport injuries are one of the main concerns of soccer players and their coaching staff and ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries in this sport. Sprains have a high recurrence in soccer, leading to pathological laxity, residual pain, and sensorimotor deficits in the ankle which could cause stability alterations known as chronic ankle instability. In this sense, numerous efforts have been made to find alternatives to reduce the incidence and recurrence of ankle sprains, but the exercise protocols designed to date are still not completely effective. Therefore, studies that deal with exercises or devices that could produce changes in ankle stability and, consequently, can reduce injury rates, are still necessary.

Stability training programmes are generally performed on unstable surfaces such as Both Sides Utilized (BOSU®), balance boards, pads, soft mats, air cushions, or tilting platforms. These tools are generally considered global instability devices (GIDs) as the direction and intensity of the instability cannot be selected and adjusted by the user. Although not yet widely studied, a new device designed to overcome these limitations is the Blackboard Training, as selective instability device (SID). In a previous study, the investigators compared muscle activation of the peroneus longus during single-leg stance on the Blackboard Training and on other GIDs (including BOSU®), finding no differences between devices. These findings may suggest that the use of the SID to improve functional ankle balance in athlete's ankle sprain preventive programs could be effective, at least, as those produced by GID, but a clinical comparison has not yet been conducted.

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of a 4-week balance training programme using a GID or SID on functional dynamic balance and functional ankle stability in young healthy amateur soccer players.

A total number of 20 amateur soccer players were randomly allocated into two groups (GID and SID). Sociodemographic, anthropometric, dynamic balance (modified Star Excursion Balance Test and Emery Test) and ankle stability (Side Hop Test) data were collected.

After a 5-minute warm up, participants performed the same exercises on their assigned device (BOSU in its inverted position for the GID group, or Blackboard with the two slats placed centrally for the SID group), which was a modified version of a previously proposed plan for proprioception training in athletes. The exercises were the same for both groups and were performed with a 3-kg medicine ball, being the only difference the unstable surface device. These were the following:

1. A 30-second series of maintaining the single-leg stance position with extended knee and hip holding the ball with the arms stretched out above the head; the free leg was kept at 90º hip and knee flexion.
2. A series of 10 repetitions where the participant was asked to pass from the supporting-leg hip and knee starting position to a 90º knee flexion squat, keeping the ball above their heads and maintaining the other leg with the knee and hip about 90º flexed.
3. A single series of 10 repetitions where the participant started with full limb extension of the supporting member and the ball held with both hands at chest height; from this position subjects were asked to bring the free leg from 45º hip extension to 45º hip flexion.
4. 10 passes between the participant and a partner where the participants started with a total extension of the supporting limb and the ball held in both hands in front of them at chest height, and their free leg flexed 90º at the hip and the knee. A 2-minute rest between exercises was allowed.

The subjects will perform pre-tests determining VO2max according to standard techniques. Subjects will be recruited through local contacts at clubs for cyclists and triathletes. Subjects should not have any medication, no nasal symptoms/disease and no asthma and be non-smokers. Subjects will be included after informed consent. All subjects answer a respiratory and training questionnaire. In total, all participants will undergo four visits to the exercise lab (CHP): the first visit for characterisation (pre-test) and the following three visits will be the exercise trials in a randomized order. All visits will take approximately 2 hours.

Experimental trials Diet and Activity Before Testing Participants will be instructed to refrain from alcohol and asked not to perform vigorous exercise on the day before each experimental trial, to record their diet on the first of these days, and to repeat this diet on days before subsequent trials.

Test day procedures Following an overnight fast, participants will be instructed to consume 500 ml plain water upon wakening. Upon arrival at the laboratory (CHP), height and nude body mass will be recorded, and a blood sample (hB) and a urine sample will be collected. A pre-trial urine specific gravity (USG) ≤1.025 (Atago, Tokyo, Japan) will be considered as a euhydrated state. Body composition will be assessed at the first experimental trial by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA; GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA). Total fat and lean mass will be analyzed using enCore software (version 16.10).

Visual analogue scale for nasal symptoms will be recorded. The nose will be examined with anterior rhinometry and with a nasal endoscope. Spirometry will be performed. Intranasal geometry and nasal airway resistance will be measured immediately before during and after the exercise test.

Following the anthropometric measurements, an incremental maximal laboratory test will be performed on a mechanically braked cycle ergometer (Monark LT2, Varberg, Sweden) adapted with a racing saddle, drop handlebars, and clip-in pedals. Initial workload will be set at 110 W and increased by 35 W every 6 min, with 2-min recovery intervals/data collection points between workloads. With assistance of a metronome, pedal rate will be kept constant at 75 rpm through the entire test. Testing will be continued until the participant no longer can maintain the required pedal rate. Heart rate (HR) will be recorded every 5 s throughout the test (Polar Electro OY, model S10i, Finland). Blood samples (Figure) will be obtained to determine blood lactate concentration (\[Lac\]) and glucose immediately after each completed workload. \[Lac\] values attained during the last workload will be considered to be maximal. Maximal power output (Wmax) will be determined as the highest workload the participant can maintain for a complete 6-min period. Environmental conditions during the experimental trials will be approximately 20°C and 40-50% relative humidity.

The exercise intensity corresponding to the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) will be identified on the \[Lac\]-power output curve by straight-line interpolation between the two closest points as the power output eliciting a \[Lac\] of 4 mmol/l .

This study is an experimental research designed as a single-group trial in which preterm infants meeting the inclusion criteria are subjected to sequentially applied right lateral, supine, and prone positions after feeding.The study included preterm infants between postnatal weeks 28 and 36, fed via orogastric tube, and receiving at least 75% of their energy intake enterally, with stable vital signs. Data collection utilized the Preterm Infant Demographic Information Form, Preterm Infant Vital Signs Observation and Monitoring Form, Neonatal Comfort Behavior Scale (ComfortNeo), and Neonatal Pain/Agitation Sedation Scale (N-PASS). According to the N-PASS, as the score increases, the pain level rises, with scale scores ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 10 point. According to the ComfortNeo Scale, as the comfort score increases, the baby's comfort level decreases, with scale scores ranging from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 30.

In this study, preterm infants included in the sample group are fed via an orogastric tube in a semi-elevated supine position during their routine feeding time and then placed in the right lateral position. The infants' heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, pain score, and comfort level data are evaluated and recorded immediately after feeding, one hour after feeding, and three hours after feeding while in the right lateral position. During the next routine feeding time, the infants are fed in the supine position and kept in this position, with their heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, pain score, and comfort level data evaluated and recorded immediately after feeding, one hour after feeding, and three hours after feeding. During the subsequent routine feeding time, the infants are fed in the supine position and then placed in the prone position. The same parameters are evaluated and recorded immediately after feeding, one hour after feeding, and three hours after feeding while in the prone position. This procedure is repeated for each infant for three days to ensure data accuracy. The positions applied to the infants are standardized and applied in the same order to prevent variability in the data.",['Premature'],INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],48,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,"[{'type': 'OTHER', 'name': 'The application of right lateral, supine, and prone positions to preterm infants after feeding', 'description': 'Each infant included in the sample group is fed at their routine feeding time (9:00 a.m.), followed by placement in the right lateral position.

NCT06480929,COMPLETED,2021-02-01,2023-02-28,"The advent of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has significantly lowered mortality rates associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite these advancements, post-infarction complications, including left ventricular (LV) thrombus, continue to negatively impact prognosis. The incidence of LV thrombus has decreased due to improved reperfusion techniques and antithrombotic therapies; however, it remains a significant risk factor for embolic events, with up to a 10% risk of stroke within a year despite anticoagulation therapy. The formation of thrombus post-AMI, particularly in anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is driven by endothelial injury, blood stasis due to LV dysfunction, and hypercoagulability from inflammation.

Anterior STEMI, usually caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, often leads to LV apical akinesia and subsequent thrombus formation within 24 hours to two weeks post-AMI. Guidelines recommend routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) post-PCI to evaluate LV function and detect early post-infarction mechanical complications and LV thrombus. However, conventional TTE can be limited by operator skill and may miss thrombi, especially in cases with suboptimal images or small/mural thrombi. Advances in ultrasound technology, including contrast agents, have improved diagnostic accuracy for LV thrombus by enhancing LV opacification and endocardial border delineation, thus identifying the characteristic ""filling defect"" of intracardiac thrombus.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced TTE as a routine screening method for detecting LV thrombus in the acute phase of anterior STEMI.

A prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted with patients admitted for anterior STEMI at Centro Hospitalar de Tondela-Viseu from November 2021 to January 2023. Patients were randomly assigned to a study group (undergoing contrast TTE) or a control group (undergoing conventional TTE). Exclusion criteria included patients under 18, those without echocardiographic or coronary angiographic evaluation, those with cardiogenic shock, known thrombus, or allergic reactions to contrast agents.

Regarding routes of administrations, DXM allows high flexibility and can be administered through intravenous (IV), intramuscular, buccal, intranasal and inhalational routes.

Nebulized DXM at 1 µg/kg is a favorable alternative to the intravenous route in short duration surgeries because it attenuates heart rate response to laryngoscopy. However, the effects of nebulized DXM on blood pressure are controversial.

The project was approved by the MetroWest Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB# 2023-100). Subject confidentiality and privacy were protected according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The research study included all voluntary patients undergoing pain management procedures from October 1, 2023 to May 15, 2024. Patients were asked about their interest in voluntarily participating in the research study. Interested patients were taken to another conference room by research staff, where the study was explained in detail, and they were given written information with enough time to consider the alternatives, risks, and benefits of participating in the research project.

Patients requiring more time to sign the informed consent or needing additional time to read the information or ask questions about the study were offered more time to decide from registration until they reached the preoperative area. In the preoperative area, research staff asked patients to confirm their decision to participate in the research project and addressed any further questions. Patients were given written information in English or Spanish, including a short form with an attestation in lay-person terminology regarding the research project and questions clarification. Basic information about the data collected and HIPAA privacy was also provided. Patients were asked to sign informed consent for enrollment into the study. All procedures were performed by one orthopedic spine surgeon Dr. Gabriel Garcia-Diaz who conducted all spinal pain injections for pain management procedures at the University Surgery Center, Merced, CA. Data was collected by Ahmadzakaria Arjmand, Ahmed Zabiba, and Ahmadzaki Arjmand.

Patients with cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral pain from a single surgical practice, OrthoSpine Advance Health, Inc., were enrolled. Procedures were performed at the outpatient University Surgery Outpatient Center. Patients were initially assessed by a single orthopedic spine surgeon with more than ten years of experience performing pain management procedures and over 12,000 interventional pain injections. The patients' procedures were ambulatory, with patients fasting, off blood thinners, and under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) by a licensed anesthesiologist or certified CRNA, followed up one week after the procedure.

All patients undergoing procedures from October 1, 2023 to May 15, 2024, were asked about their interest in participating in the research study. Interested patients were taken to another conference room by research staff, where the study was explained in detail, and they were given enough time to consider the alternatives, risks, and benefits of participation. If patients needed more time to read the information or ask more questions, they were offered additional time to decide from registration until they reached the preoperative area. In the preoperative area, patients were asked by research staff to confirm their decision to participate in the research project and address any remaining questions. After deciding to participate, patients were assigned a User ID, which was added to the assigned official injection list from the University Surgery Center for cross-reference. This process ensured that only participating patients with User IDs were included in the official procedure list without identifying patient information in the general data collection sheet.

After assigning the User ID, patients were stratified based on the procedure to be performed. Patients were categorized into groups depending on the procedure: Category I for sacroiliac joint blocks, Category II for transforaminal injection blocks (T-thoracic, L-lumbar), Category III for medial branch blocks (C-cervical, T-thoracic, L-lumbar), and Category IV for radiofrequency ablation (C-cervical, T-thoracic, L-lumbar). Each category was randomly distributed into four cohort groups (A, B, C, D) for each syringe size (5ml, 10ml, 20ml, 30ml). The syringes and needles used during the procedures were manufactured by BD, McKesson, or Stryker (Table 1).

For all patients undergoing injections, basic preoperative labs were collected: CBC and differential, PT, PTT, INR, and urinalysis.

The study employed a novel method for measuring the force required to inject medications using different syringe sizes. A ""force/sensor plunger"" complex was attached to the syringe for ""real-time"" force data analysis. This device did not come in direct contact with patients and was enclosed in a sterile field, minimizing the risk of contamination. The force/sensor plunger complex was the safest proposed model designed for humans to be attached to the syringe for ""real-time"" force data analysis. It did not come in direct contact with the patient and was used at the outside distal end of the syringe plunger enclosed in a sterile field only to collect data for real-time syringe force drug delivery. As such, it was a Class 1 medical device that did not pose a reasonable risk for illness or injury to the patient. The device was only used for clinical design control/trial and not for regular/common use.

There was minimal risk of contamination or any change in the standard of care for the treatment offered besides collecting real-time peak force data analysis. The force/sensor plunger complex did not interfere with the handle of the syringe, and the monitor was located more than three feet away from the patient. The sterile enclosure field was created at the force/sensor plunger complex, isolating it from the patient and maintaining the sterile surgical field with non-significant risk of contamination.

The force/sensor plunger complex did not perform, change, or interact with anything except to record the force exerted by the physician. It did not interfere with the flow, time, or location of medicine insertion in the body. All parameters were under the control of the physician as usual. The equipment was cleaned and sanitized according to approved surgical cleaning and sanitizing agents. The entire cart with contents was wiped down, and the wheels were sprayed with 70% IPA before entering the operating room. Dedicated equipment carts were routinely cleaned and sanitized. All equipment used in the force/sensor plunger complex was sanitized using sterile IPA wipes. The force/sensor plunger complex model was validated in a cadaver model in 2019 and with a control group at UC Merced in 2023 before requesting permission and approval for data collection. There was no change in the procedure or equipment used for the proposed model.

Based on the information, a request was made for IRB board allowance of the use of the force/sensor plunger professional medical grade equipment to collect the necessary syringe real-time force data analysis required and exempt it from complying with the requirements as Medical Device Class I or for a 510(k) submission. If the force/sensor plunger complex was considered a medical device, it should require FDA Medical Class 1 General Controls established in 21CFR part 801, 803, and 807, and a 510 K exemption should be requested. For data collection, there was minimal to zero risk to the patient and minimal risk of contaminating the sterile field. The study was performed for the first time in humans after validation in cadavers, demonstrating the model provided non-significant risk to patients.

The model involved attaching an MR02-100 force sensor to the outside top of the syringe plunger to measure the peak force exerted at the syringe tip. To maintain the sterile field, the assembly/plunger complex was covered in a small container using Velcro to attach it internally, with a thin slit for the cable to exit and connect to the monitor. A sterile glove was placed over the container, creating a sterile cover over the sensor/plunger complex with sterile tape. The force sensor/plunger complex was connected to a digital force monitor (Digital Force Monitor M71) torque indicator for high-speed data capture. Multifunctional cables AC1100 connected all necessary ports, and a Plug and Test Adapter (PTA) connected the sensor to the monitor displaying the force. MESUR gauge Plus Load for travel analysis software with the monitor was used for peak force analysis.

The digital screen allowed recording of the peak force applied on the plunger, from which pressure was calculated using the equation Pressure = Force/Area. Patients were categorized into groups and randomly distributed into four cohort groups (A, B, C, D) for each syringe size (5ml, 10ml, 20ml, 30ml). Peak force data was collected, and the corresponding pressure was calculated for each cohort group. The sensors or experimental devices used in this study did not come in direct contact with human skin or require sterilization.

Patients were followed up one week after the procedure and advised to call the office if there were any adverse reactions. The study confidentiality was monitored using HIPAA safety practices.

The polychromatic structure of natural teeth presents a challenge to shade selection. Consequently, the prevailing trend towards simplification of shade matching has led to the emergence of single-shade universal composites. Single-shade universal composites are able to replicate the natural colour of teeth by capturing the structural colour based on the size of the filler particles. Unlike other materials, it does not require the use of additional dyes or pigments. The blending, colour induction and colour assimilation effects of resin composites are collectively referred to as the chameleon effect. This phenomenon allows resin-based restorative materials to achieve a shade that closely resembles the colour of the surrounding tooth structure. The intelligent monochromatic composite makes shade selection easier for the clinician and provides a quick and easy way to create aesthetic restorations. Its distinctive character reduces confusion and potentially saves time in the clinic.

NCT06473402,COMPLETED,2024-05-16,2024-06-04,"Flexibility is the ability of the muscle to move in a single or a series of joint planes within an unrestricted range of motion. Muscle flexibility is an important element of muscle functionality and has a very important place in ensuring the biomechanical function of the muscle. One of the advantages of flexibility in the context of literature is its ability to enhance athletic performance, decrease the likelihood of injury, alleviate or minimize post-exercise discomfort, and improve coordination. Furthermore, it serves as a crucial aspect for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Limited flexibility causes the person to be prone to various musculoskeletal system overuse injuries and significantly affects functionality. Flexibility is different for each muscle. This difference depends on the adaptation of the muscle to the stresses placed on the muscle. Decreased flexibility is usually seen in fast-twitch muscles that span two joints. Hamstring muscles are a typical example of this. In normal daily activities, the physiological amplitudes of the hamstring muscles are rarely fully realized. For this reason, hamstring muscles are one of the muscle groups that tend to shorten. Hamstring shortness occurs in almost all populations worldwide, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The causes of hamstring shortness include genetic factors, adaptation of the muscle to acute or chronic injury, sitting in a sitting position for a long time, etc. countable. Some studies have stated that decreased hamstring flexibility may cause patellar tendinopathy, patellofemoral pain, hamstring strain, and muscle damage after eccentric exercise.Therefore, the flexibility of the hamstring muscles must be maintained. Flexible hamstrings can prevent acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries, low back pain, posture deviations, gait limitations and the risk of falls. Stretching exercises are often performed to increase hamstring flexibility . There are also different methods to increase hamstring flexibility. A widely used approach is manual therapy. According to Greenman, this method can strengthen weak muscles by restoring their normal length when they are shortened, contracted, or affected by spasticity. In addition, manual therapy can help reduce edema by promoting the lymphatic system's pumping action. This approach also enhances the mobility of joints with limited movement.

Another alternative method is massage application. Massage is believed to increase blood flow to the muscles and increase muscle temperature, thus improving performance. In addition to the effects mentioned above, massage is believed to reduce the risk of injury by increasing flexibility and reducing stiffness.

The rate of use of massage guns has increased significantly, especially in recent years, by athletes, coaches and physiotherapists. Perhaps the most important reasons why it is so popular are that it helps to increase sports performance and increase the level of flexibility. According to the literature, applying the sacroiliac joint muscle energy technique and percussion massage to the hamstring muscle has been shown to increase hamstring flexibility. However, there is no study available that compares the immediate effects of applying the sacroiliac joint muscle energy technique versus percussion massage on hamstring shortness. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare the instant effects of sacroiliac joint muscle energy technique and percussion massage applications on hamstring flexibility.","['Muscle Tightness', 'Muscle Spasm']",INTERVENTIONAL,['NA'],30,TREATMENT,"[{'type': 'DIAGNOSTIC_TEST', 'name': 'Muscle Strength Test', 'description': 'Hamstring muscle strength of the participants was measured with a dynamometer (Microfet 2, Hoggan Health Industries, HHD) with the knee flexed at 90 degrees.

Prior to contact and recruitment, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 12 weekly food deliveries and support from a CHW (Food + CHW group) or food deliveries only (Food-only group).

All participants receive 12 weekly contactless deliveries of food. CHWs conduct three virtual study visits with participants to administer surveys and/or collect biomarker measurements at weeks 1, 12, and 24. No changes in the frequency of visits with the patient's provider are recommended. Virtual visit 1 involves the completion of study forms, assessment of household size for most meals, cultural preferences, food allergies, baseline cooking and eating habits, and assessment for knowledge and usage of local and/or federal food support programs. At week 12, participants use at home kits and devices (provided by the study) to measure and report their HbA1C, weight and blood pressure and complete post-intervention surveys on diet, knowledge and usage of food access programs and resources, and an anonymous feedback questionnaire on the strengths and opportunities for improvement in the program. At week 24, participants measured and reported their final HbA1C, weight and self-collected blood pressure result.

In addition to food, participants in the Food + CHW group also received 7 weekly virtual sessions with a CHW (four 90-minute ZOOM counseling sessions and three 30 to 60-minute check-in phone calls). CHW sessions included diabetes-appropriate cooking and nutrition education and personalized benefit enrollment and linkage to existing food access resources (for example Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Double up Food Bucks, and Kansas Senior Farmers Market Vouchers).

NCT06470464,COMPLETED,2021-11-11,2024-06-16,"Thalidomide (THD) is currently widely used in the treatment of immune rheumatic diseases, blood tumors and solid tumors. Solid tumors are mostly used in the treatment of lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., and are limited to patients with advanced or advanced tumors. The main mechanisms of its action are inhibition of angiogenesis, immune regulation, induction of apoptosis, target teratogenesis and so on. However, whether from animal experiments or clinical studies, thalidomide alone or in combination with chemotherapy has not been seen to have a very effective therapeutic effect or exact clinical application in the treatment of these solid tumors.

According to the latest relevant case analysis reports and clinical trial results abroad, TIP regimen is still the priority recommended treatment regimen in the previous data for children with recurrent and refractory malignant germ cell tumors. However, the combination of Sirolimus and TIC regimen (nab-paclitaxel + isocyclophosphamide + carboplatin) previously explored by our research group can greatly improve the remission rate of recurrent and refractory germinal cell tumors, especially for recurrent and refractory yolk sac tumors, a certain proportion can be cured or the opportunity for surgery and radiotherapy can be obtained to achieve cure. However, there are still some children who are insensitive or progress again after 2 cycles of remission. For these children with multiple relapsed or particularly difficult yolk sac tumors, there is no effective treatment plan in the world at present, and there is no relevant clinical trial. However, through our clinical experience and understanding in the treatment process of these children, The results of thalidomide combined with TGA chemotherapy regimen (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + epirubicin) were satisfactory. Therefore, we hope to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and adverse reactions of this regimen through clinical trials, so as to provide an effective treatment option for children with recurrent and refractory yolk sac tumor.
