Capturing this dynamism is the only way to better understand the natural history of multimorbidity and shed light on hitherto unexplained findings.","detailedDescription":"* Design: Mixed-method study.\n\n  * Quantitative study: retrospective and prospective observational study. It integrates demographic and clinical information from electronic medical records and clinical-administrative databases. It involves the harmonisation of the cohorts of users of the public health system of the 7 participating regions.\n  * Qualitative study with a phenomenological and ethnographic approach using focus group techniques, semi-structured interviews and Photovoice to find out the perspective of patients and professionals in shared decision-making.\n  * Systematic literature review on the effectiveness of interventions on training, multimorbidity and polypharmacy in health professionals.\n* Analysis:\n\n  * Quantitative study: Cluster, network and trajectory analysis\n  * Qualitative study: Thematic content analysis that will be triangulated among the members of the research team. Meanings will be interpreted and an explanatory framework will be created with the contributions of each type of informant."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multimorbidity"],"keywords":["Multimorbidity","Primary Health Care","Trajectories","Mixed-methods","Patterns","Qualitative study","Discussion group","Semi-structured interviews","Photovoice","Shared decision-making","Cluster"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"10 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3239950,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Quantitative Aim","description":"Ambispective longitudinal observational study","interventionNames":["Other: Retrospective and prospective cohort"]},{"label":"Qualitative Aim","description":"Focus group, semi-structured interviews and Photovoice","interventionNames":["Other: Focus group, semi-structured interviews and Photovoice"]},{"label":"Systematic Review Aim","description":"Systematic literature review on the effectiveness of interventions on training, multimorbidity and polypharmacy in health professionals.","interventionNames":["Other: Systematic review"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Retrospective and prospective cohort","description":"* Retrospective study: Population-based retrospective cohort study with RWD.
