To protect patients, following TPFM imaging, patients will receive standard of care evaluation on permanent sections, thus all patients will receive standard of care confirmation following experimental imaging. Individual excisions from consenting patients will be selected, fluorescently labeled and the distance to inked margins measured with TPFM. Following imaging, specimens will be submitted for paraffin processing as per normal procedure and the resulting slides scanned. The distance to the inked margin will be measured on the permanent sections and compared to TPFM to determine accuracy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Basal Cell Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TPFM imaging of surgical margins","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Excised tissue will be imaged with TPFM to determine the distance from tumor to nearest inked margin.","interventionNames":["Device: Two photon fluorescence microscopy imaging"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Two photon fluorescence microscopy imaging","description":"Excised tissues will be imaged with two photon fluorescence microscopy prior to submission for histological processing.","armGroupLabels":["TPFM imaging of surgical margins"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quantitative agreement between clear margin distance on TPFM and conventional paraffin embedded histology","description":"The distance from the furthest extent of the tumor to the nearest surgical margin will be measured on both TPFM and conventional paraffin histology and the numerical difference calculated.","timeFrame":"Upon receipt of postoperative pathology slides, typically 2-4 weeks post surgery"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall agreement on margin status","description":"The status of margins (positive/negative) will be compared","timeFrame":"Upon receipt of postoperative pathology slides, typically 2-4 weeks post surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Undergoing treatment for basal cell carcinoma without Mohs surgery at the performance site\n* Able to read and understand consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Michael Giacomelli, Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"5852766260","email":"mgiacome@ur.rochester.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Michael Giacomelli","affiliation":"University of Rochester","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Rochester Dermatologic Surgery","city":"Victor","state":"New York","zip":"14654","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Sherrif Ibrahim, MD-Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"585-222-1400","email":"dr.ibrahim@rochesterdermsurgery.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":42.98256,"lon":-77.40888}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36069886","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Ching-Roa VD, Huang CZ, Ibrahim SF, Smoller BR, Giacomelli MG.
