treatment of Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) compared to usual inpatient management could improve quality of care and represent a more efficient, generalizable and sustainable strategy.\n\nThis

of an ambulatory strategy for the management of large abundance primary spontaneous pneumothorax in the emergency department, compared with usual care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Primary
