## Description
This project is to develop machine learning methods to predict clinical trial duration based on registered study information, including study description, enrollment, study type, eligibility criteria, study plan, start date and so on. Simultaneously, we seek to understand the contributions of various features to prolonged trial durations and provide recommendations to optimize study protocols and reduce trial duration.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthree.git
cd healthree
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
