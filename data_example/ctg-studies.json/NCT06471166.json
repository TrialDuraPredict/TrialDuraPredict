Given the potential emergent nature of presentation, women will not be recruited if fully informed consent could be compromised due to a highly distressed emotional state or significant hemorrhage necessitating the need for urgent surgery\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The use of hormonal contraceptives within two months of enrolment\n2. If other surgery was conducted at the time of salpingectomy.\n3. If a woman was pregnant at follow up visit for AMH measurement\n4.
