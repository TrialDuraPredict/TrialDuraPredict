The purpose of this study is to find out if the investigational drug angiotensin-(1-7) can improve cardiovascular health in people with obesity and high blood pressure.","detailedDescription":"A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study will be conducted to determine if acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) infusion reduces cardiovascular sympathetic tone and blood pressure and improves the function of blood vessels in participants with obesity hypertension. This is an outpatient study that requires a screening visit, and if eligible, two study visits separated by at least one week in the Clinical Research Center within the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. The study visits will include intravenous infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) or saline for approximately two hours, starting with increasing doses and holding at a steady-state dose. Endothelial function will be measured and blood samples collected at baseline and at the end of infusion. Blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (via microneurography) will be measured continuously throughout the study. Each study visit will last approximately 4 hours."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity","Hypertension"],"keywords":["Angiotensin-(1-7)","Cardiovascular","Sympathetic Nervous System","Blood Pressure","Endothelial Function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Angiotensin-(1-7)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) at one study visit for a total of 120 minutes.
