Preliminary research findings suggest that the addition of CD25 monoclonal antibody at +3 days post unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) has reduced the incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD compared to previous protocols. In order to further explore how to improve prevention strategies of aGVHD and reduce the incidence of severe aGVHD, we performed this study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a prophylactic GVHD regimen utilizing CD25 monoclonal antibody post-UCBT for malignant hematologic disorders, aimed at reducing the incidence of severe aGVHD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Graft Versus Host Disease","Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Addition of CD25 monoclonal antibody at +3 days post unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT)","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"basiliximab group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Basiliximab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Basiliximab","description":"Addition of CD25 monoclonal antibody（Basiliximab） at +3 days post unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT)","armGroupLabels":["basiliximab group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The cumulative incidence of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD)","description":"The primary endpoint of the study will be the development of aGVHD in the first 100 days post-transplant.
