The polychromatic structure of natural teeth presents a challenge to shade selection. Consequently, the prevailing trend towards simplification of shade matching has led to the emergence of single-shade universal composites. Single-shade universal composites are able to replicate the natural colour of teeth by capturing the structural colour based on the size of the filler particles. Unlike other materials, it does not require the use of additional dyes or pigments. The blending, colour induction and colour assimilation effects of resin composites are collectively referred to as the chameleon effect. This phenomenon allows resin-based restorative materials to achieve a shade that closely resembles the colour of the surrounding tooth structure. The intelligent monochromatic composite makes shade selection easier for the clinician and provides a quick and easy way to create aesthetic restorations. Its distinctive character reduces confusion and potentially saves time in the clinic. However, the effectiveness of this material in matching different shades of natural teeth remains uncertain, and there is a paucity of clinical evidence on the efficacy of its colour-matching capabilities in dental restorations."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Dental Diseases"],"keywords":["blending","color match","composite resin","esthetics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Two groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Omnichoroma","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anterior non-carious cervical lesions restored with Omnichoroma single-shade resin composite.","interventionNames":["Other: Omnichoroma"]},{"label":"Charisma Topaz One","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anterior non-carious cervical lesions restored with Charisma Topaz One single-shade resin composite.","interventionNames":["Other: Charisma Topaz One"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Omnichoroma","description":"Patients with anterior non-carious cervical lesions were treated with Omnichoroma.
