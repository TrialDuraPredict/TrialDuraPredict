Thirty four (34) patients with unilateral SIS.\n2. Male and female subjects will be included between 20 and 40 years of age .\n3. Shoulder pain and disability level will be measured using the Arabic version of shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI).\n4. Thoracolumbar lateral deviation will be measured using a scoliometer.\n5. Scapular dyskinesia will be measured using lateral scapular slide test (LSST).\n6. The pelvic tilting angle and shoulder height angle will be evaluated using Kinovea software.\n7. Trunk side bending ROM will be evaluated using a bubble inclinometer .\n8. Trunk side bending strength will be evaluated using a handheld dynamometer.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nIt will be assumed that:\n\n1. The instructions given to all individuals will be clear with satisfying explanations for all assessment methods.\n2. All individuals will follow the instructions.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nIt will be hypothesized that:\n\n1. There will be no significant correlation between pain score and measured variables in patients with unilateral SIS:\n\n   1. lateral spinal deviation\n   2. scapular dyskinesia\n   3. pelvic tilting angle in the frontal plane\n   4. shoulder height angle in the frontal plane\n   5. ipsilateral trunk lateral side bending ROM\n   6. contralateral trunk lateral side bending ROM\n   7. ipsilateral trunk lateral side bending strength\n   8. contralateral trunk lateral side bending strength\n2.
