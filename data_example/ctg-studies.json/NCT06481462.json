An ideal pain management approach after a cesarean section should provide high-quality analgesia with minimal side effects and facilitate the mother's rapid return to daily activities. Different options for pain control include central blocks, peripheral blocks, and systemic medications.\n\nIntrathecal morphine (ITM) administration is a widely used approach for post-cesarean pain management both globally and in our clinic. However, it can reduce patient satisfaction due to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and itching. On the other hand, the Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB), a type of peripheral block, has proven analgesic efficacy in controlling acute postoperative pain following a cesarean section. The aim of this study is to examine and compare the analgesic efficacy of intrathecal morphine (ITM) and Posterior Quadratus Lumborum in the management of acute postoperative pain after a cesarean section.\n\nThis study is a single-center, double-blind, prospective observational study.\n\nPatients will be divided into 2 groups.\n\nGroup 1: The group receiving intrathecal morphine (ITM)\n\nGroup 2: The group receiving Posterior Quadratus Lumborum Block\n\nIn elective cesarean section cases under spinal anesthesia, the patient group receiving ITM and posterior QLB will be evaluated for obstetric general well-being during the first 24 hours and at discharge. Total morphine consumption in the first 24 hours, Pain scores (NRS) at rest and during movement, presence of nausea-vomiting and itching, patient satisfaction and any potential side effects will be recorded through follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Anesthesia","Postoperative Pain"],"keywords":["Cesarean section","intrathecal morphine","posterior quadratus lumborum block"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"2 Days","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intrathecal Morphine","description":"A subarachnoid block will be performed by injecting morphine 100 mcg + 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine + 10 mcg fentanyl.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Intrathecal Morphine (ITM)"]},{"label":"Posterior Quadratus Lumborum Block","description":"Patients scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia will receive bilateral ultrasound-guided posterior quadratus lumborum block.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Quadratus Lumborum II (QLB-II) Block"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Intrathecal Morphine (ITM)","description":"morphine 100 mcg + 12.5 mg bupivacaine + 10 mcg fentanyl","armGroupLabels":["Intrathecal Morphine"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Quadratus Lumborum II (QLB-II) Block","description":"12.5 mg bupivacaine + 20 mcg fentanyl bilateral QLB block (posterior tip 2) 25 cc 0.25% bupivacaine","armGroupLabels":["Posterior Quadratus Lumborum Block"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Morphine consumption in the first 24 hours after surgery","description":"Morphine consumption in the first 24 hours will be measured by IV PCA.
