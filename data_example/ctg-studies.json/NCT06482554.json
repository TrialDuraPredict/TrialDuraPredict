after the last dose of study drug.\n* Must speak and understand English, as the consent and all evaluations will be conducted in English.\n* Must be willing to take and pass a urine drug screen with a negative result in order to rule out psychotic symptoms due to drugs of abuse.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A BPRS score \\< 35 at the screening visit.\n* An AES-C score \\< 32 at the screening
