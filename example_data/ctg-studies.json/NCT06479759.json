There are two cohorts in the study:(1)Cohort 1: NSCLC patients who developed secondary resistance after being sensitive to prior treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (monotherapy or in combination with another systemic therapy) for 6 months or more are eligible for this study.(2)Cohort 2: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have not received prior systemic treatment are eligible for this study.\n\nSubjects in Cohort 1 will receive LM-108 monoclonal antibody combined with sintilimab. Subjects in Cohort 2 will receive LM-108 monoclonal antibody combined with sintilimab and chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles. LM-108 monoclonal antibody combined with sintilimab will be maintained, and the choice of chemotherapy regimen and the duration of use will be determined by the investigator. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of a new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, death, or other investigator-determined reasons for discontinuation, whichever occurs first, with a maximum treatment duration of 24 months. The primary study endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigator based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC","PD-1"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohort 1 patients receive LM-108 monoclonal antibody combined with sintilimab.","interventionNames":["Drug: LM-108 antibody and sintilimab"]},{"label":"Cohort 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohort 2 patients receive LM-108 monoclonal antibody combined with sintilimab and chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles.
