In addition there is no available treatment to date apart from supportive therapy such as renal replacement therapy.\n\nTherefore, early identification of patient-specific biomarkers and other clinical predictors could help to better understand the association with AKI and other patient outcomes. In addition to the \"classical\" risk factors (age, diabetes, pre-existing CKD), frailty might represent another important variable, as shown in previous observational studies. Importantly frailty is not unique to age, although it occurs in approximately 25% of those over 65 and affects more than half of the population aged 85 and older, as it has been shown to be highly prevalent in hospitalized patients and/or patients with CKD. Furthermore, in preclinical studies the serum protein Fetuin-A was identified as potential biomarker for vascular surgery associated AKI.\n\nPEAK is a single center, prospective observational study involving several clinics at the University Hospital Bern. Besides from demographic data and perioperative parameters, blood and urine are collected with high granularity during and immediately after surgery (15min after the first cut, start and end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) or aortic clamping (X-clamp), 4 hours after surgery) and at day 1, 2, 3, and 7 (or discharge) post-surgery. In addition renal function will be assessed at day 90. Furthermore, study participants will answer the Edmonton frailty questionnaire at baseline and at day 90."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acute Kidney Injury","Surgery-Complications","Frailty"],"keywords":["Kidney","Renal","Cardiac","Thoracic","Abdominal","Valvular replacement","CABG","Aneurysm","cardiopulmonary bypass","Ischemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Serum, Plasma, Urine"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline of serum Fetuin-A values","description":"Measurement of serum Fetuin-A at baseline and at the various sampling time-points mentioned above.","timeFrame":"Baseline to day 90"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"BMI","description":"Body mass index of participants in (kg/m2), integer: min 15 (extreme underweight), max 45 (extreme overweight)","timeFrame":"Baseline and day 90"},{"measure":"eGFR","description":"estimated glomerular filtration rate in (ml/min)","timeFrame":"Baseline and day 90"},{"measure":"Proteinuria","description":"Albumin in urine normalized to creatinine in categorized into 3 groups:\n\n1. \\<30 mg/d\n2. 30-300 mg/d\n3. \\>300 mg/d","timeFrame":"Baseline and day 90"},{"measure":"ASA score","description":"ASA score (anesthesia), 1-6, (1 = healthy, 6 = brain dead)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Euroscore II","description":"Euroscore II, predicted mortality in (%)","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"STS score (only for cardiac surgery)","description":"Society of Thoracic Surgeons Score in (%), higher values predict higher risk","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Duration of ECC (only for cardiac surgery)","description":"Time on extracorporeal circuit in (min)","timeFrame":"Peri-operative"},{"measure":"Duration of X-clamp (only for aortic surgery)","description":"Time of X-clamping in (min)","timeFrame":"Peri-operative"},{"measure":"Lowest body temperature","description":"Lowest body temperature recorded during surgery in (°C)","timeFrame":"Peri-operative"},{"measure":"SAPS II score","description":"Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II°C), in-hospital mortality at ICU admission, integer min 1, max 200, higher values predict higher mortality","timeFrame":"After Operation to day 7"},{"measure":"Urine output","description":"Daily urine volume in (ml)","timeFrame":"After Operation to day 7"},{"measure":"Assessment of AKI incidence and severity at day 7 in association with change in serum Fetuin-A levels over time","description":"AKI will be assessed as a binary outcome (presence/absence)\n\nBiomarkers for AKI severity include levels of direct Fetuin-A targets, kidney function parameters, predictors of AKI or CKD (NGAL, suPAR, Nephrocheck®, or YKL-40), hemolysis (hemoglobin, transferrin), inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines or growth factors), and exploratory assessments (proteomics, metabolomics).","timeFrame":"Baseline to day 7"},{"measure":"Assessment of AKI to CKD progression at day 90 in association with change in serum Fetuin-A levels over time","description":"CKD will be evaluated as a binary outcome (presence/absence) based on renal functional parameters.","timeFrame":"Baseline to day 90"},{"measure":"Assessment of the patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) frailty in association with progression to CKD and worse clinical outcome","description":"Frailty in terms of patient-related outcome will be reported as a paired difference of mean frailty score (Edmonton Frail Scale) between baseline and 90-days visit.
