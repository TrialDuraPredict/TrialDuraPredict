Subjects will be randomized to receive magnesium or not receive it, as part of a standardized general anesthetic for prostate surgery. The primary objective is to demonstrate improved pain scores in patients receiving magnesium sulfate as an adjunctive analgesic during surgery. Secondary objectives include demonstrating reduced requirements for other opioids, reduced postoperative shivering, improved discharge home and adequate neuromuscular blockade reversal, measured by quantitative train of four monitoring."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostatectomy"],"keywords":["Prostate surgery","analgesia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Magnesium","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients in the first group will receive 2 grams magnesium sulfate at the end of surgery as a bolus over approximately 10 minutes intravenously.","interventionNames":["Drug: Magnesium sulfate"]},{"label":"No magnesium","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients in the second group will receive no magnesium."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Magnesium sulfate","description":"Pre-mixed solution of 2 grams of magnesium sulfate dissolved in 20 mL sterile water","armGroupLabels":["Magnesium"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pain score","description":"Patients will be asked to assess their pain based on a 10-point scale, where 0=no pain and 10=worst imaginable pain.","timeFrame":"30 minutes after awakening from anesthesia"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pain score","description":"Patients will be asked to assess their pain based on a 10-point scale, where 0=no pain and 10=worst imaginable pain.","timeFrame":"60 minutes after awakening from anesthesia"},{"measure":"Pain score","description":"Patients will be asked to assess their pain based on a 10-point scale, where 0=no pain and 10=worst imaginable pain.","timeFrame":"120 minutes after awakening from anesthesia"},{"measure":"Number of participants who experienced nausea or vomiting","timeFrame":"Up to 120 minutes after awakening from anesthesia"},{"measure":"Number of participants who experienced postoperative shivering","timeFrame":"Up to 120 minutes after awakening from anesthesia"},{"measure":"Number of participants who received analgesics in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU)","timeFrame":"Through PACU stay, on average 2 hours"},{"measure":"Time to administration of analgesics","timeFrame":"From awakening from anesthesia to administration of analgesic, up to 120 minutes postoperative"},{"measure":"Dose of opioid analgesia given","description":"Dose of opioid analgesia given will be measured in milligram morphine equivalents","timeFrame":"Through PACU stay, on average 2 hours"},{"measure":"Number of patients who were admitted to the hospital","timeFrame":"From PACU admission to discharge, up to 120 minutes postoperative"},{"measure":"Number of patients who were discharged home","timeFrame":"From PACU admission to discharge, up to 120 minutes postoperative"},{"measure":"Train-of-four (TOF) ratio","description":"Train- of-four ratio (TOF) is the ratio of the fourth muscle response to the first one.","timeFrame":"TOF ratios will be measured for the duration of the operation, approximately 3 hours"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
