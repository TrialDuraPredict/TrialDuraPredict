There are no studies evaluating Q angle in patients with OP and Osteopenia (OPN) in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the Q angle in patients diagnosed with OP and OPN and to compare it with patients diagnosed with OA. The study will be carried out by measuring the Q angle measurement with a goniometer. Pain assessment will be done with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Lower extremity muscle strength will be assessed with the Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale. Foot posture will be assessed with the Foot Posture Index (FPI).","detailedDescription":"Osteoporosis (OP) is a bone disease characterized by reduced bone density and deterioration of bone tissue, leading to an increased risk of fractures. According to Calis et al; it was found that patients with hip fracture had a significantly higher Q angle compared to patients without hip fracture. According to You et al; contraction of the quadriceps muscles corrects the Q angle, therefore sports that use high amounts of quadriceps (strength) training are associated with lower Q angles due to the pulling effect of the quadriceps muscle. There are no studies evaluating Q angle in patients with OP and Osteopenia (OPN) in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the Q angle in patients diagnosed with OP and OPN and to compare it with patients diagnosed with OA. The study will be carried out by measuring the Q angle measurement with a goniometer. Pain assessment will be done with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Lower extremity muscle strength will be assessed with the Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale.
