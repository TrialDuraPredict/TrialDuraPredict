After surgery, an adjuvant systemic treatment is generally proposed (hormone therapy, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy).\n\nSide effects of endocrine treatments, including skin toxicities, are frequent and often underestimated, leading to poor treatment adherence that can compromise therapeutic outcomes. Among adjuvant chemotherapy treatments, one of the most used drug is Paclitaxel: at skin level it can induce rash, dry skin and itching.\n\nThe combination of radiotherapy with these oncological treatments could aggravate cutaneous side effects.\n\nAim of this study is to characterize the chemical/physical and structural parameters of the skin in patints with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant treatment, performing specific skin tests with professional instruments and adequate personnel. The evaluation will be carried out in Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy with Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitor or Paclitaxel +/- adjuvant radiotherapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer","Estrogen Receptor Positive Tumor"],"keywords":["Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer","Adjuvant Treatment","Skin Toxicity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tamoxifen","description":"Patients who are receiving treatment with tamoxifen in adjuvant setting","interventionNames":["Other: Skin tests"]},{"label":"Aromatase Inhibitors","description":"Patients who are receiving treatment with an aromatase inhibitor in adjuvant setting","interventionNames":["Other: Skin tests"]},{"label":"Paclitaxel","description":"Patients who are receiving treatment with Paclitaxel in adjuvant setting","interventionNames":["Other: Skin tests"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Skin tests","description":"Acquisition of Skindex questionnaire 29 and execution of instrumental skin tests","armGroupLabels":["Aromatase Inhibitors","Paclitaxel","Tamoxifen"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Forearm hydration degree assessmnent","description":"Forearm hydration degree evaluated using instrumental skin tests","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Evaluation of Effects of Skin Disease on Quality of Life","description":"Collection of Skindex29 questionnaire (minimum value: 1, maximum value: 5 - higher scores mean a greater agreement with the statement)","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* age between 40 and 70 years\n* subjects who are receiving treatment with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor or paclitaxel in adjuvant therapy +/- adjuvant radiotherapy\n* subjects who are receiving hormonal therapy must have suspended any chemotherapy for at least 30 days\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* presence of known chronic skin pathologies before adjuvant treatment start (psoriasis, lupus, atopic dermatitis)\n* inability to understand and will\n* unavailability to carry out all the tests required by the protocol","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Giulio Tosti, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39 0257489318","email":"giulio.tosti@ieo.it"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Giulio Tosti, MD","affiliation":"European Istitute of Oncology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"European Institute of Oncology","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Milan","zip":"20141","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Giulio Tosti, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39 0257489318","email":"giulio.tosti@ieo.it"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":45.46427,"lon":9.18951}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001943","term":"Breast Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000001941","term":"Breast Diseases"},{"id":"D000012871","term":"Skin Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M5220","name":"Breast Neoplasms","asFound":"Breast Cancer","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M5218","name":"Breast Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15674","name":"Skin Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M8116","name":"Estrogens","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M19537","name":"Paclitaxel","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M231","name":"Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M16403","name":"Tamoxifen","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25769","name":"Aromatase Inhibitors","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"},{"abbrev":"ANeo","name":"Antineoplastic Agents"},{"abbrev":"BDCA","name":"Bone Density Conservation Agents"}]}},"hasResults":false}
