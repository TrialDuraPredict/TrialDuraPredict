Those who demostrate a suboptimal response from ruxolitinib alone will then be randomized 2:1 to receive navtemadlin or navtemadlin placebo as add-on treatment to their ongoing ruxolitinib. Randomized means that subjects will be assigned to a group by chance, like a flip of a coin. The study is blinded, meaning the subjects, doctors, central endpoint assessors and sponsor will not know which add on treatment (navtemadlin or navtemadlin placebo) the subject is receiving."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myelofibrosis","Post-PV MF","Post-ET Myelofibrosis","Primary Myelofibrosis","MF"],"keywords":["Navtemadlin","KRT-232","Ruxolitinib","POIESIS","TP53","Suboptimal response","Sub-optimal response"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Placebo-controlled","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Navtemadlin administered orally once daily on Days 1-7, off treatment on Days 8-28, in 28-day treatment cycles.
