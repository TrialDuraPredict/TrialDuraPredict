Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (49 cases) and the control group (49 cases).\n\nDuring the screening phase, hydrocortisone butyrate cream or desoximetasone cream was topically applied twice daily to the affected areas, along with the emollient twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks until the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score was â‰¤1, indicating entry into the intervention phase. In the intervention phase, the experimental group discontinued the corticosteroid creams and continued with the emollient twice daily, while the control group discontinued both medication and emollient.\n\nThe recurrence of AD, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Infant/Child Dermatology Quality of Life Index (IDQOL/CDQOL), and adverse events were assessed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 of the intervention phase. Additionally, non-invasive measurements of skin barrier function were conducted, including:\n\nTransepidermal water loss (TEWL) to assess water loss from the skin. Skin electrical capacitance to measure water retention in the stratum corneum. Skin pH to determine the skin's acidity level."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Atopic Dermatitis","Eczema","Emollient"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":98,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment with an Emollient Containing Postbiotic Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Treatment with an Emollient Containing Postbiotic Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus"]},{"label":"Treatment without an Emollient Containing Postbiotic Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus","type":"NO_INTERVENTION"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Treatment with an Emollient Containing Postbiotic Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus","description":"Treatment with an Emollient Containing Postbiotic Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus, with the dose of 100g per week,lasting for 12weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Treatment with an Emollient Containing Postbiotic Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recurrence rate during the intervention phase","description":"During the intervention phase, when the patient's Investigator's Gobal Assessment (lGA) score reaches 2 or higher, we defined it as recurrence.","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
