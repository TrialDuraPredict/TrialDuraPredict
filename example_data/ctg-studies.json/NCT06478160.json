If the patient does not meet the non-inclusion or exclusion criteria and consents to participate in the study, he/she will be randomized to the CBSD-experimental group or waste discard volume- control group.\n\nIf the patient belongs to the CBSD-experimental group, the CBSD will be placed in the arterial line at that moment. All extractions performed will be through the arterial catheter and using the CBSD.\n\nIn the waste discard volume- control group, the arterial catheter will also be used for extractions but with the usual open extraction system of the ICU. To quantify the blood loss related to blood collection for laboratory tests, the volume of discharge (VD) used for each analysis through the arterial catheter will be recorded. In the CBSD-experimental group the VD for arterial catheter will be zero since CBSD will always be used. The laboratory tubes extracted in each analysis will also be recorded.\n\nData on blood analysis, blood transfusion and adverse events related to the arterial catheter will be recorded daily during the ICU stay, up to day 21 maximum and/or day of ICU discharge and/or exitus.\n\nPatients discharged from ICU to hospitalization will be followed only during the first 48h to know if they have received red blood cell concentrates and with what previous Hemoglobine (Hb) and hematocrit (Hto).\n\nCatheter insertion and maintenance will be carried out in the same way in both groups."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Acceptability of Health Care"],"keywords":["anaemia","transfusion","diagnostic blood loss","phlebotomy","blood management","hospital-acquired anemia","iatrogenic anemia","sampling practices","blood conservation","blood sample collection","catheter-related infections","critical care","nursing","blood conservation devices","clinical trial","laboratory testing","blood chemistry tests"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Outcomes Assessor and statistician who analyze the results","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":216,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CBSD-experimental group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"blood collection with Closed-Blood Sampling System (CBSD)","interventionNames":["Device: Closed-Blood Sampling Devices"]},{"label":"Waste discard volume, control group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Blood collection without CBSD, usual practice, need to waste discard volume","interventionNames":["Other: Waste discard volume"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Closed-Blood Sampling Devices","description":"blood collection with Closed-Blood Sampling System (CBSD)","armGroupLabels":["CBSD-experimental group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Waste discard volume","description":"Blood collection without CBSD, usual practice, need to waste discard volume","armGroupLabels":["Waste discard volume, control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Units of red blood cells transfusion","description":"Number of red blood cells (RBC) units administered in both study groups","timeFrame":"Every day during the ICU stay and up to a maximum of 21 days after randomization (day 0)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Volume of blood drawn","description":"Volume of blood drawn in mL for laboratory testing in both study groups","timeFrame":"Every day during ICU stay and up to a maximum of 21 days after randomization (day 0)."},{"measure":"Levels of hemoglobine and hematocrit","description":"Hemoglobin (Hb) in g/dL and hematocrit (%) in both study groups","timeFrame":"Every day during ICU stay and up to a maximum of 21 days after randomization (day 0)."},{"measure":"Number and type of adverse events","description":"Arterial catheter-related adverse events in both groups (infection and/or catheter obstruction; lose of arterial pressure monitoring)","timeFrame":"Every day during the stay and up to a maximum of 21 days after randomization (day 0):"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients with an arterial catheter who agree to participate in the study, with a stay in the ICU of 24h and a minimum of 72h more with an arterial catheter\n\nNon-inclusion criteria: Therapeutic Limitation of Life Support, Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with chronic renal failure\n* Patients with active gastrointestinal bleeding\n* Patients diagnosed with hematologic cancer\n* Women with menstruation at the time of admission\n* Pregnant women\n\nWithdrawal criteria: presence of active gastrointestinal bleeding during the study inclusion period.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Raurell-Torreda Marta, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"626154955","phoneExt":"0034","email":"mraurell@ub.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Raurell-Torreda Marta","affiliation":"University of Barcelona","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31912207","type":"RESULT","citation":"Vlaar AP, Oczkowski S, de Bruin S, Wijnberge M, Antonelli M, Aubron C, Aries P, Duranteau J, Juffermans NP, Meier J, Murphy GJ, Abbasciano R, Muller M, Shah A, Perner A, Rygaard S, Walsh TS, Guyatt G, Dionne JC, Cecconi M.
