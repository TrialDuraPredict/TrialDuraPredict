A secondary aim is to determine the effects of fasted prolonged exercise on serum leptin and cortisol.\n\nParticipants will be asked to do the following over a \\~3 month enrollment period:\n\n* attend a laboratory visit at the beginning of the study to have their resting metabolic rate, aerobic fitness, and body composition tested\n* monitor their menstrual cycle length, urine hormones, perceived stress levels, and diet for \\~3 months\n* complete 3, 90-minute exercise sessions on a stationary bike or treadmill either fed (consuming a carbohydrate meal 1 h prior and 0.7 g carbohydrate/ kg body mass/ h during exercise) or fasted (consuming no meal prior and no carbohydrates during exercise) during month \\~3\n* saliva samples will be taken prior to and after 90-minute exercise sessions for quantification of leptin and cortisol"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Menstrual Irregularity"],"keywords":["functional hypothalamic amenorrhea","menstrual cycle","female athlete"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":64,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fed with Carbohydrates","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will complete 3, 90-minute stationary cycle or treadmill exercise sessions 1 h after consuming a meal containing 1 g carbohydrate/ kg body weight.
