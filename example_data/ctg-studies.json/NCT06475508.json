Participants received an intravenous dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg once 4 weeks. The time on study treatment was 24 weeks.","detailedDescription":"Complarate® (INN: tocilizumab) is being developed as a biosimilar to the drug Actemra®, a concentrate for the preparation of a solution for infusion.\n\nTocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody to the human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor from the IgG1 subclass of immunoglobulins. Tocilizumab binds to and inhibits both soluble and membrane IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R).\n\nThis III phase study is aimed to compare the effectiveness, safety and immunogenicity of Complarate® and Actemra®. The study included patients aged 18-75 years at the time of signing the informed consent form with a documented diagnosis of RA, established according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, at least 6 months before screening, with moderate or high degree of disease activity and insufficient response to methotrexate monotherapy (preservation of moderate/high disease activity for at least 3 months) and/or poor tolerability of methotrexate (including the subcutaneous form of the drug) and/or insufficient response to or intolerance to other synthetic disease-modifying anti-inflammatory drugs (sDMARDs) with or without methotrexate inclusive, who meet all criteria for participation in the study. The study included a screening period and a treatment period. Allocation of patients to treatment groups was carried out by randomization in a ratio of 2:1 to the study drug (Complarate®) and comparator drug (Actemra®). 465 patients (310 to the study drug group and 155 to the comparator drug group) were randomized."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rheumatoid Arthritis"],"keywords":["tocilizumab","humanized monoclonal antibodies","safety","rheumatoid arthritis","equivalence","biosimilar","American College of Rheumatology (ACR)","DAS28","disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)","rheumatic autoimmune disease","European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)","immunogenicity","Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)","Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Throughout the study neither the investigators nor the patients knew which drug was being administereduntil the end of the comparative treatment study period","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":465,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Complarate® (JSC \"GENERIUM\", Russia)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"tocilizumab bisimilar","interventionNames":["Biological: Complarate®"]},{"label":"Actemra® (F.
