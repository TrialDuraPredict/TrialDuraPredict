Symptoms generally affect quality of life significantly, and they range from minor discomfort and drainage with resultant hygienic problems to sepsis. Different classifications have been put forward which categorize these Fistula into low or high simple or complex, or according to their anatomy inter-sphincteric, trans-sphincteric, and supra- sphincteric or extra-sphincteric.\n\nConventional laying-open technique in high perianal fistula may involve sacrifice of part or whole of the sphincter muscle impairing continence. A transposition technique for the management of high anal and anorectal fistulae is described by Mann and Clifton in 1985. The method involves re-routing the extrasphincteric portion of the track into an intersphincteric position with immediate repair of the external sphincter.\n\nCoring-out fistulectomy is a type of sphincter-preserving procedure that enables accurate resection of the fistula tract alone and thus reduces the possibility of missing a secondary tract"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coring Out","Fistulectomy","Internal Sphincter","Lay Open Fistulotomy","Sphincter Repair","Transsphincteric Perianal Fistula"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Coring out Fistulectomy with Closure of Internal Sphincter Opening","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients underwent coring out fistulectomy with closure of internal sphincter opening","interventionNames":["Procedure: Coring out Fistulectomy with Closure of Internal Sphincter Opening"]},{"label":"Lay Open Fistulotomy and Primary Sphincter Repair","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients underwent lay open fistulotomy and primary sphincter repair","interventionNames":["Procedure: Lay Open Fistulotomy and Primary Sphincter Repair"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Coring out Fistulectomy with Closure of Internal Sphincter Opening","description":"The patient was laid in the lithotomy position.
