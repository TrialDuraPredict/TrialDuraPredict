Appetitive responses will serve as the primary outcome. Combinations for comparison will include lentil and sweet potato chili, macaroni and cheese, fish tacos, chicken and pea fried rice, pita and hummus, and creamy pork pasta."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Healthy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"7 crossover arms for each subject","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1 (lean steak and potatoes)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"lean steak and potatoes will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]},{"label":"Arm 2 (lentil and sweet potato chili )","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"lentil and sweet potato chili will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]},{"label":"Arm 3 (macaroni and cheese)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"macaroni and cheese will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]},{"label":"Arm 4 (fish tacos)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"fish tacos will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]},{"label":"Arm 5 (chicken and pea fried rice)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"chicken and pea fried rice will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]},{"label":"Arm 6 (pita and hummus)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"pita and hummus will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]},{"label":"Arm 7 (creamy pork pasta)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"creamy pork pasta will be provided to subjects and primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at timelines explained under primary and secondary outcome measures.","interventionNames":["Other: Food items"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Food items","description":"Participants will be fed \\~400 kcal palatable meals on separate occasions to test for changes in blood glucose and insulin levels as well as appetite over a 4-hour period of time.","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1 (lean steak and potatoes)","Arm 2 (lentil and sweet potato chili )","Arm 3 (macaroni and cheese)","Arm 4 (fish tacos)","Arm 5 (chicken and pea fried rice)","Arm 6 (pita and hummus)","Arm 7 (creamy pork pasta)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"appetite response","description":"Using 100 mm visual analog scales (score from 0 to 100 and higher score means more)","timeFrame":"baseline (B), 15 minutes from B, 30 minutes from B, 45 minutes from B, 60 minutes from B, 90 minutes from B, 120 minutes from B, 150 minutes from B, 180 minutes from B, 210 minutes from B, 240 minutes from B"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"blood glucose","description":"measuring blood glucose level","timeFrame":"baseline (B), 15 minutes from B, 30 minutes from B, 45 minutes from B, 60 minutes from B, 90 minutes from B, 120 minutes from B, 150 minutes from B, 180 minutes from B, 210 minutes from B, 240 minutes from B"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* ages of 18-50 years\n* BMI between 18-26\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* special dietary needs (e.g., gluten-free, etc.),\n* 5% weight change in the previous 2 months,\n* smoking, and substance use.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"San Diego State University","city":"San Diego","state":"California","zip":"92182-7251","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":32.71533,"lon":-117.15726}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M10365","name":"Insulin","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M173166","name":"Insulin, Globin Zinc","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Hypo","name":"Hypoglycemic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
