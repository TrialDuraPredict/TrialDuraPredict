The goal of this 6-month study is to test the acceptability, feasibility, and fit of the intervention in an integrated primary care clinic serving people living with HIV.","detailedDescription":"Single-session interventions are designed to address barriers to engaging in care and address the issues of long waitlists and limited provider availability. Offering a single session intervention soon after a referral is made is a strategy on a stepped-care continuum model that has been found to be an effective approach to manage population mental health needs. This study aims to 1) pre-pilot a single-session narrative therapy intervention with patients currently on the waitlist for psychotherapy services at an HIV primary care clinic to evaluate the acceptability of this treatment option for patients and the feasibility of proposed data collection followed by 2) a 6-month pilot study of the same intervention to evaluate intervention acceptability, fit, and impact on service and clinical outcomes. At the end of this study, patient and provider-level data on the utility of integrating a single-session psychotherapy service as part of the continuum of behavioral health services in an integrated care setting will be obtained, which the investigators can utilize to design a larger implementation-effectiveness trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mental Health Issue","HIV","Substance Use"],"keywords":["Brief narrative therapy","Implementation outcome","Stepped care","Psychotherapy","Integrated primary care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single Session Narrative Therapy Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A single 60-75 minute narrative therapy session with a trained licensed behavioral health provider will be offered to patients on the psychotherapy waitlist of an HIV primary care clinic.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Single Session Narrative Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Single Session Narrative Therapy","description":"Single-session narrative psychotherapy intervention is an evidence-based strategy on a stepped care continuum that can assist patients in accessing care when they most need it and can lead to the most effective utilization of scarce resources.
