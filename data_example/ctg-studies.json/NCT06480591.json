Patients who have MPN with the CALR mutation positive will be approached for interest in participating in this study. A research blood collection will occur at any time during the participant's cancer trajectory after enrollment, during a standard of care blood draw. The participant's demographics, MPN subtype, CALR mutation status, history of thrombosis/other medical history, and current, concomitant medications will be collected once. Clinical data will be collected, including results from the CBC with differential, complete metabolic panel (if available), and PT/PTT/INR (if available) drawn closest to the research blood collection. This study will initially open as a single center study at AHWFBCCC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Myeloproliferative Neoplasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"JAK2 V617F mutation positive MPN patients","description":"Patients with MPN disease with a JAK2 mutation","interventionNames":["Other: Blood Draw"]},{"label":"CALR-mutation positive patients","description":"Patients with MPN disease with a CALR mutation","interventionNames":["Other: Blood Draw"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Blood Draw","description":"The amount of blood that will be collected for this is 50 mL(milliliters), or about 3 ½ tablespoons.","armGroupLabels":["CALR-mutation positive patients","JAK2 V617F mutation positive MPN patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Expression levels of TLR 2 and TLR 4","description":"Percentages of mononuclear cells expressing TLR 2 and TLR 4 will be calculated for each participant.","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines","description":"Presence and levels of inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α, will be recorded by multiplex Elisa for each participant.","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines following incorporation of TLR ligands","description":"Presence and levels of inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α, will be calculated for each participant using the in vitro cell culture system.","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"History of thrombosis","description":"Determined for each participant as a binary variable indicating whether this participant had history of thrombosis.","timeFrame":"24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Written (or electronic) informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information by participant or his/her legally authorized representative (LAR).\n* Age ≥ 18 years at the time of enrollment\n* Diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) according to 2022 World Health Organization classification of MDS/MPNs\n* CALR-positive genetic mutation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n- Diagnosis of MPN with JAK2 V617F mutation","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients seen in the clinic with MPN with the CALR mutation will be identified and approached for consent.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Courtney Schepel","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(980) 292-0817","email":"Courtney.Schepel@atriumhealth.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Aleksander Chojecki, MD","affiliation":"Atrium Health Levine Cancer","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Atrium Health Levine Cancer","city":"Charlotte","state":"North Carolina","zip":"28204","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Courtney Schepel","role":"CONTACT","phone":"980-292-0817","email":"Courtney.Schepel@atriumhealth.org"},{"name":"Aleksander Chojecki, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":35.22709,"lon":-80.84313}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO","description":"Releasing the Individual Participant Data (IPD) is not required to meet the study objectives, and therefore is not planned to be released.
