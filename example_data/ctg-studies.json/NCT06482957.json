sarcoma diagnosis and treatment have had on patients over time.","detailedDescription":"* To evaluate the incidence and prevalence and the impact of disease, treatment, sociodemographic and lifestyle contributors on adverse oncologic outcomes (lack of response, recurrence) and non- oncologic outcomes (physical and psychosocial function, financial toxicity, short and long-term organ toxicity) and mortality in the cohort.\n* To evaluate the role of drug metabolism and DNA repair genes via functional polymorphisms, known toxicity associated polymorphisms and genetically predicted gene expression levels, as well as polygenic risk scores, on treatment efficacy, cancer therapy-induced normal tissue toxicity and mortality.\n* To identify genomic drivers of sarcoma and to use this information to develop personalized liquid biopsy assays for monitoring treatment response, recurrence, and minimal residual disease (MRD) and mortality.\n* Evaluate family functioning, psychosocial wellbeing, and financial toxicity.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nPatients monitor physical activity, sedentary behavior, heart rate and sleep wearing a FitBit device, undergo blood urine, stool and/or saliva sample collection, complete surveys and have medical records reviewed throughout study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational","description":"Patients
