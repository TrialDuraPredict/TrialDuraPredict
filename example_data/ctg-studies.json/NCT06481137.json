In addition, the investigators will evaluate the need for cardiac pacing and the incidence of clinical events in patients with negative EPS performed 3-7 days following TAVI.\n\nIn this multicenter, longitudinal, prospective study, patients with clinical indication of EP study due to new-onset ECG-CDs after TAVI will be included. A permanent pacemaker will be implanted in patients with positive EPS and a second EPS will be performed in 30-45 days. Additionally, these patients will undergo 4-week continuous monitoring using the ePatch (Philips) long-term Holter recorder, to identify episodes of paroxysmal complete atrioventricular block. Patients with negative EP study will undergo clinical follow-up and continuous monitoring for 4 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Stenosis","Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation","Conduction Disturbances"],"keywords":["Aortic stenosis","Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation","Conduction Disturbances"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":209,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Positive initial (3-7 days following TAVI) electrophysiological study (EP+)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Permanent pacemaker implantation.
