This study is to determine the efficacy and validity of procedure and that following procedure patients had decreased pain and improved quality of life.","detailedDescription":"Embolic Solution are intended for use in occluding blood vessels for therapeutic or operative purposes. The embolic solution is used during an outpatient procedure, the physician will insert a small catheter onto the artery supplying the lining of the target joint or target localized pain. Tiny particles are then injected through the catheter into these arteries, reducing blood flow to the target area. This reduces the amount of inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, tendonitis, tenosynovitis or an injury, a process that can help decrease symptoms or eliminate the associated localized pain to this area. With understanding that it does not treat the underlying cartilage destruction or underlying condition causing pain but would like to determine the efficacy and validity of this treatment. For the study to determine efficacy and overall improvement of patients post procedure by comparing patient's pain preoperative and post operatively, if there is a decreased use of medication preoperatively compared to post procedure and increased quality of life preoperative and post procedure. Clinical outcomes of improvement will be determined by improvement of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC), EQ-5D-5L Quality of Life Questionnaire, and to determine if patients had decrease used of medication prescribed preoperatively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Pain","Osteoarthritis, Knee","Osteoarthritis Thumb","Osteoarthritis Shoulder","Pain, Chronic","Tendonitis Elbow","Tendonitis Shoulder","Tendonitis;Achilles","Tenosynovitis"],"keywords":["Pain","Osteoarthritis","Arthritis","Tendonitis","Tenosynovitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"12 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group","description":"For the study to determine efficacy and overall improvement of patients post artery embolization by comparing patient's pain preoperative and post operatively, if there is a decreased use of medication preoperatively compared to post procedure and increased quality of life preoperative and post procedure.
