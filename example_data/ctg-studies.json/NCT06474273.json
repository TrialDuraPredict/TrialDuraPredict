This happens because the body sometimes makes a mistake and tries to get rid of the organ. This problem is called \"rejection\". One type of rejection is known as Acute T cell mediated rejection (TCMR). This can lead to many problems or even stop the transplant from working.\n\nDoctors give strong steroids to treat this problem, but there are no rules for how much steroid to give. Too much steroids can cause problems like heart and bone problems, bad infections, and weight gain. That's why we need to find the right dose of steroids for each person to treat this.\n\nTACKLE-IT is a study that will try to find the right steroid dose for treating rejection.","detailedDescription":"TACKLE-IT is an international, multi-centre, 2x2 factorial, registry-based, single-blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compares the effectiveness and safety of high vs low dose IV MP, and high vs low dose oral prednisone taper as the first-line therapy for acute TCMR in kidney and SPK transplant recipients. This RCT was conceived and developed through extensive consultation and collaboration with our key stakeholders, including transplant recipients with lived experience and the International TCMR Working Group with sponsorship by 4 international transplant societies (The Transplantation Society (TTS), American Society of Transplantation (AST), European Society of Transplantation (ESOT) and Transplant Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ). TACKLE-IT is led by an international multi-disciplinary team of transplant health professionals, clinical trialists, biostatisticians, health economist, social scientist, consumers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rejection; Transplant, Kidney","Rejection; Transplant, Pancreas"],"keywords":["Acute T cell mediated rejection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"2x2 factorial, single-blind, non-inferiority, RCT of lower vs higher dose IV MP (methylprednisolone), and lower vs higher oral prednisone dose augmentation.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"As a single-blind study, all participants will be blinded to the allocation of the IV MP treatment comparisons.
