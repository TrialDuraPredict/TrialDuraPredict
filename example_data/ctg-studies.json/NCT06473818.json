Therefore, monitoring hemodynamics, including maternal CO, is of significant importance and provides guidance for anesthesia decisions such as fluid management and the administration of vasopressors during cesarean section. This study aims to evaluate the consistency of hemodynamic monitoring between NICAP and NICCO technologies (T20A; Chongqing, China) and the traditional pulse wave analysis method (EV1000; USA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hemodynamics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Normotensive pregnant women","description":"Singleton pregnancy ≥37 weeks, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I to II scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia","interventionNames":["Device: Non-invasive monitoring","Device: Invasive monitoring"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Non-invasive monitoring","description":"Non-invasive cardiac output monitoring","armGroupLabels":["Normotensive pregnant women"],"otherNames":["Hemodynamics"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Invasive monitoring","description":"Invasive cardiac output monitoring","armGroupLabels":["Normotensive pregnant women"],"otherNames":["hemodynamics"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Cardiac output (CO)","description":"Monitoring data","timeFrame":"1-60 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"Cardiac index (CI)","description":"Monitoring data","timeFrame":"1-60 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"Stroke volume (SV)","description":"Monitoring data","timeFrame":"1-60 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"Stroke volume variation (SVV)","description":"Monitoring data","timeFrame":"1-60 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"Peripheral vascular resistance","description":"Monitoring data","timeFrame":"1-60 minutes after spinal anesthesia"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension","description":"Systolic blood pressure (SBP) \\< 80% of the baseline","timeFrame":"1-15 minutes after spinal anesthesia."},{"measure":"The incidence of severe post-spinal anesthesia hypotension","description":"Systolic blood pressure (SBP) \\< 60% of the baseline","timeFrame":"1-15 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"The incidence of bradycardia","description":"Heart rate \\< 60 beats/min","timeFrame":"1-15 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"The incidence of nausea and vomiting.","description":"Presence of nausea and vomiting in patients after spinal anesthesia","timeFrame":"1-15 minutes after spinal anesthesia"},{"measure":"The incidence of hypertension","description":"Systolic blood pressure (SBP) \\>120% of the baseline","timeFrame":"1-15 minutes after spinal anesthesia"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18-45 years\n* Primipara or multipara\n* Singleton pregnancy ≥37 weeks\n* American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I to II\n* Scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Body height \\< 150 cm\n* Body weight \\> 100 kg or body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2\n* Eclampsia or chronic hypertension or baseline blood pressure ≥140 mmHg\n* Hemoglobin \\< 7g/dl\n* Fetal distress, or known fetal developmental anomaly","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Singleton pregnancy ≥37 weeks, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I to II scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Yi Chen, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86-951-674-3252","email":"czzyxgp@163.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Yi Chen, M.D.","affiliation":"General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4107","name":"Anesthetics","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
