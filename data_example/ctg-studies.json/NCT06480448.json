Treadmill training is evaluated for its potential to improve cardiovascular fitness and alleviate constipation through its rhythmic movements. The findings shed light on the broader health benefits of treadmill interventions beyond motor function improvement in children with CP","detailedDescription":"This research investigates the effects of treadmill training on two distinct yet interconnected aspects of health in children with cerebral palsy (CP): cardiorespiratory endurance and constipation.\n\nThe research employs a longitudinal design, with participants undergoing a structured treadmill training program tailored to their individual needs and abilities. Outcome measures include objective assessments of cardiorespiratory fitness (e.g., exercise stress tests, spirometry) and subjective evaluations of constipation symptoms (e.g., bowel diaries, symptom questionnaires). Additionally, the study examines potential correlations between improvements in cardiorespiratory endurance and changes in constipation severity, exploring the interplay between physical fitness and gastrointestinal function in children with CP.\n\nBy investigating the effects of treadmill training on both cardiorespiratory endurance and constipation, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the broader health benefits associated with exercise interventions in children with cerebral palsy. The findings may inform the development of integrated rehabilitation programs that address multiple aspects of health and well-being in this population, ultimately improving overall quality of life and functional outcomes."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardiopulmonary"],"keywords":["motor function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Traditional physical therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will only getting conventional therapy which include core stability training, strength training, gait training through Parallel bar etc.","interventionNames":["Other: Traditional physical herapy"]},{"label":"Treadmill training","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will getting treadmill training will be started along with conventional therapy group.

During the test, individuals are instructed to walk as far as they can within a six-minute period along a flat, straight course. The test is typically conducted in a corridor or along a marked pathway, and the distance covered is recorded at the end of the test.\n\nBefore the test begins, participants receive instructions on the procedure and are given the opportunity to ask questions. Baseline measurements such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation may be taken. Participants are encouraged to walk at a self-selected pace, and they are allowed to rest if needed during the test. However, the timer continues to run during rest periods.","timeFrame":"Baseline - 12th Week"},{"measure":"Heart Rate","description":"The number of pulses over a minute is the standard heart rate measurement.
