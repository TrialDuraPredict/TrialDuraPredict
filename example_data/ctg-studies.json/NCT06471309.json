Functional near- infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to detect the changes in activation and functional connectivity of related brain regions in PSD patients treated with intermittent TBS（iTBS）stimulation on the affected side and consistent TBS（cTBS） stimulation on the healthy side. To investigate the effects of TBS on swallowing related cortical excitability in stroke patients with dysphagia and explore its possible mechanism, and provide theoretical basis for the treatment of PSD patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stroke","Dysphagia","Functional Near- Infrared Spectroscopy","Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Bilateral stimulation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"On the basis of routine treatment and routine swallowing rehabilitation training, iTBS treatment was given to the representative area of mylohyoid cortex on the affected side and cTBS treatment was given to the representative area of mylohyoid cortex on the healthy side","interventionNames":["Device: Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Unilateral stimulation group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"On the basis of routine treatment and routine swallowing rehabilitation training, iTBS treatment was given to the representative area of mylohyoid cortex on the affected side and sham cTBS treatment was given to the representative area of mylohyoid cortex on the healthy side","interventionNames":["Device: Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation"]},{"label":"Sham stimulation group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","description":"On the basis of routine treatment and routine swallowing rehabilitation training, sham iTBS treatment was given to the representative area of mylohyoid cortex on the affected side and sham cTBS treatment was given to the representative area of mylohyoid cortex on the healthy side","interventionNames":["Device: Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation","description":"The stimulation intensity of TBS was 80%RMT, with a total of 600 pulses, five times a week for two weeks.
