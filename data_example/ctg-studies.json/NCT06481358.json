SETTING: We developed a deep learning-based AI technology to automatically extract the intestinal tract from CT images using 5 200 CT images of 158 patients. The CT images of patients who visited the emergency department and were suspected of small bowel obstruction between June 6 and July 26, 2018, were obtained from two tertiary referral centers, which were used as the test samples. Data analysis was completed in December 2023.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: Residents and surgeons participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Residents and surgeons were divided into two groups: one group read using the AI technology, and the other group read without the AI technology.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants indicated whether or not small bowel obstruction and obstruction location. The time for diagnosis was also collected. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bowel Obstruction","Artificial Intelligence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AI group","description":"Participants read CT images with AI.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Artificial intelligence"]},{"label":"Manual group","description":"Participants read CT images without AI"}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Artificial intelligence","description":"AI extract intestinal region and reconstruct into 3D image.","armGroupLabels":["AI group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The diagnosis of the obstruction site","description":"Accuracy of diagnosis of the obstruction site","timeFrame":"September, 2024"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persons with documented consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Persons without documented consent","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"20 people","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Hieoo Uchida, PhD.","affiliation":"Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Pediatric Surgery","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine","city":"Nagoya","state":"Aichi","zip":"4668560","country":"Japan","geoPoint":{"lat":35.18147,"lon":136.90641}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000007415","term":"Intestinal Obstruction"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007410","term":"Intestinal Diseases"},{"id":"D000005767","term":"Gastrointestinal Diseases"},{"id":"D000004066","term":"Digestive System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M10449","name":"Intestinal Obstruction","asFound":"Bowel Obstruction","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10444","name":"Intestinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8883","name":"Gastrointestinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7255","name":"Digestive System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
