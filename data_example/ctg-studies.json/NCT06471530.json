Study TE-8105-101 consists of 2 parts: Part A (single-ascending dose \\[SAD\\]) and Part B (multiple-ascending dose \\[MAD\\]).","detailedDescription":"Part A consists of 4 cohorts, with an optional adaptive cohort which may be opened if needed approximately 24 eligible participants will be assigned to Part A (SAD) (6 participants in each cohort). Part A is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg (or ≤ 2.5 mg), and 3 mg (or ≤ 5 mg) TE-8105. Each participant will receive one dose of TE-8105 injection via subcutaneous (SC) injection into the abdomen administered on Day 1.\n\nPart B consists of 2 cohorts. Approximately 12 participants will be assigned to Part B (MAD) (6 participants in each cohort). Part B is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple SC doses of 0.5 mg (or ≤ 1.5 mg) and 1.0 mg (or ≤ 3 mg) TE-8105 once every 2 weeks (Q2W). The dose levels and dosing interval of Part B may be adjusted based on the results of Part A. Each participant will receive 5 doses of TE-8105 injection via SC injection into the abdomen.\n\nProgression from Part A to Part B will be based on the recommendation of the SRC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Overweight and Obesity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Part A SAD Cohort 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcutaneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 SAD Cohort 1"]},{"label":"Part A SAD Cohort 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcutaneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 SAD Cohort 2"]},{"label":"Part A SAD Cohort 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcutaneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 SAD Cohort 3"]},{"label":"Part A SAD Cohort 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcutaneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 SAD Cohort 4"]},{"label":"Part A SAD Cohort 5 (Adaptive Cohort)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcuteneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 SAD Cohort 5 (Adaptive cohort)"]},{"label":"Part B MAD Cohort 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcutaneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 MAD Cohort 1"]},{"label":"Part B MAD Cohort 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Each participant will receive TE-8105 administered by subcutaneous injection.","interventionNames":["Drug: TE-8105 MAD Cohort 2"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 SAD Cohort 1","description":"Each participant will receive one dose of TE-8105 0.5 mg injection via subcutaneous (SC) injection into the abdomen administered on Day 1.","armGroupLabels":["Part A SAD Cohort 1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 SAD Cohort 2","description":"Each participant will receive one dose of TE-8105 0.75 mg injection via subcutaneous (SC) injection into the abdomen administered on Day 1.","armGroupLabels":["Part A SAD Cohort 2"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 SAD Cohort 3","description":"Each participant will receive one dose of TE-8105 1.5 mg or less than or equal to 2.5 mg injection via subcutaneous (SC) injection into the abdomen administered on Day 1.","armGroupLabels":["Part A SAD Cohort 3"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 SAD Cohort 4","description":"Each participant will receive one dose of TE-8105 3 mg or less than or equal to 5 mg injection via subcutaneous (SC) injection into the abdomen administered on Day 1.","armGroupLabels":["Part A SAD Cohort 4"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 SAD Cohort 5 (Adaptive cohort)","description":"Each participant will receive one dose of TE-8105 less than or equal to 6 mg injection via subcutaneous (SC) injection into the abdomen administered on Day 1.","armGroupLabels":["Part A SAD Cohort 5 (Adaptive Cohort)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 MAD Cohort 1","description":"Each participant will receive 5 doses of TE-8105 0.5 mg or less than or equal to 1.5 mg injection via SC injection into the abdomen on Day 1 and then Q2W for 5 doses.","armGroupLabels":["Part B MAD Cohort 1"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"TE-8105 MAD Cohort 2","description":"Each participant will receive 5 doses of TE-8105 1 mg or less than or equal to 3 mg injection via SC injection into the abdomen on Day 1 and then Q2W for 5 doses.","armGroupLabels":["Part B MAD Cohort 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety and tolerability of TE-8105 by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events","timeFrame":"SAD: From Screening until Day 43 (End of study) post dose.
