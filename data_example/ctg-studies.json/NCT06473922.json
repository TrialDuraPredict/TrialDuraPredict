Up to 15% of the world's adult population suffers from high anxiety about dental treatments. The stress resulting from this anxiety may cause a delay in the healing and fusion of the surgical wound. Therefore, it is possible to perform this surgical tooth extraction procedure under general anesthesia.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to assess the level of anxiety/fear and to monitor the wound healing process among patients who are about to undergo surgery to remove wisdom teeth or no more than 3 jaw implants under local anesthesia in the dental clinic compared to patients who are about to undergo the same surgery under general anesthesia.","detailedDescription":"Tooth extraction is one of the most common surgical procedures in dentistry. Up to 15% of the world's adult population suffers from high anxiety about dental treatments. The stress resulting from this anxiety may cause a delay in the healing and fusion of the surgical wound. Therefore, it is possible to perform this surgical tooth extraction procedure under general anesthesia.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to assess the level of anxiety/fear and to monitor the wound healing process among patients who are about to undergo surgery to remove wisdom teeth or no more than 3 jaw implants under local anesthesia in the dental clinic compared to patients who are about to undergo the same surgery under general anesthesia.\n\nThe various measurements of the study will include:\n\nLevel of free cortisol hormone in saliva.The levels of this hormone are correlated to the level of fear\n\nThe level of fear of pain will be measured using the Fear of Pain Questionnaire - (FPQ-III)\n\nThe level of fear of dental pain will be measured using the short version of the fear of dental pain questionnaire - FDPQ\n\nLevel of dental anxiety - will be measured using by the dental anxiety scale of The DAS Corah\n\n. To monitor the inflammation and wound healing, the inflammatory proliferation scale (IPR) will be used to monitor the wound healing process\n\nThe study includes 5 visits:\n\nVisit 1: 5-7 days before surgery - in the waiting room of the dental clinic. The patients will sign an informed consent form, fill out questionnaires and a saliva test will be taken from them. A clinical assessment will be conducted by the surgeon\n\nVisit 2: on the day of surgery, in the waiting room of the dental clinic or the operating room (depending on the type of anesthesia planned). The patients will fill out questionnaires and a saliva sample will be taken from them\n\nVisit 3: 5 days after the surgery - in the waiting room of the dental clinic The patients will fill out questionnaires and a saliva sample will be taken from them. The surgeon will report complications and complete the IPR.\n\nVisit 4: 14 days after surgery The surgeon will complete the IPR.\n\nVisit 5: 6 weeks after surgery The surgeon will complete the IPR."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tooth Extraction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"General anasthesia","description":"Patients who are about to undergo surgery to extract wisdom teeth or no more than 3 implants in the jaw under general anesthesia in a hospital operating room.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Reginal anesthesia"]},{"label":"Regional anesthesia","description":"Patients who are about to undergo surgery to extract wisdom teeth or no more than 3 implants in the jaw under regional anesthesia in the dental clinic","interventionNames":["Procedure: Reginal anesthesia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Reginal anesthesia","description":"General anesthesia","armGroupLabels":["General anasthesia","Regional anesthesia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Level of fear","description":"Level of fear from pain and dental fear will be monitored by questionnaireד","timeFrame":"From visit 1 which will be 5-7 days before surgery to visit 5 which will be 6 weeks after surgery"},{"measure":"Wound healing","description":"Will be monitored by the IPR questionnaire","timeFrame":"From visit 3 which will be 5 days after surgery to visit 5 which will be 6 weeks after surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAge - from ≥ 18 years, ASA 1- or 2, Signing a written informed consent before starting all procedures related to the research, Ability to cooperate with the researcher and meet the research requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Male and females, over 18 years of age who about to undergo surgery to extract wisdom teeth or no more than 3 implants in the jaw under local anesthesia in the dental clinic or under general anesthesia in a hospital operating room.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Sara Bar Yehuda, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"972528981004","email":"sarabar1@shamir.gov.il"},{"name":"Zoya Haitov Ben Zikri, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"972537346186","email":"ZoyaC@shamir.gov.il"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Sara Bar Yehuda, PhD","affiliation":"Shamir (Asaf Harofe) medical center","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Shamir (Asaf Harofe) Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Be'er Ya'aqov","zip":"70300","country":"Israel","contacts":[{"name":"Sara Bar Yehuda, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"972528981004","email":"sarabar1@shamur.gov.il"},{"name":"Zoya Haitov Ben Zikri, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"972537346186","email":"ZoyaC@shamir.gov.il"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":31.93864,"lon":34.83749}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M17685","name":"Wounds and Injuries","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M4324","name":"Anxiety Disorders","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC26","name":"Wounds and Injuries"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BXM","name":"Behaviors and Mental Disorders"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000000777","term":"Anesthetics"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002492","term":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"id":"D000045505","term":"Physiological Effects of Drugs"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4107","name":"Anesthetics","asFound":"Function","relevance":"HIGH"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"CNSDep","name":"Central Nervous System Depressants"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false}
