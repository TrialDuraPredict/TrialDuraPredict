However, colchicine is still not approved for CHD treatment in China. There is no large-scale clinical evidence that colchicine can be used to treat Chinese patients with CHD. Considering the low body weight of the East Asian population, it is unclear whether the recommended standard dose (0.5 mg/day) is suitable for Chinese patients. Therefore, we need to further explore the effects of different doses of colchicine on the efficacy and safety of clinical endpoints in the Chinese population with CHD.\n\nThis study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, event-driven clinical study conducted in China. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether long-term treatment with different doses of colchicine reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events in Chinese patients undergoing PCI. The secondary objective is to determine the safety of long-term treatment with different doses of colchicine in this patient population.","detailedDescription":"After informed consent, 8862 subjects who meet all inclusion will be randomly assigned to receive colchicine (0.5 mg/day), colchicine (0.375 mg/day), or placebo (1:1:1 allocation ratio), with follow-up at months (1, 6, 12, 18, 24...) after randomization, and phone assessments at months (3, 9, 15, 21...). The occurrence of any endpoints or other adverse events will be assessed every 3 months. Subjects will also receive standard medical care for antiplatelets, control of dyslipidemia, hypertension, angina and diabetes as directed by national guidelines. All suspected cardiovascular endpoints will be adjudicated by the Clinical Event Committee (CEC, consisting of three experienced members blinded as to allocation of therapy). The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB, consisting of five fully independent members) will review unblinded safety data as detailed in the DSMB charter. An interim analysis is planned after approximately 50% of primary endpoints have been positively adjudicated. The DSMB charter will pre-specify the methodology for the interim analysis and the rules for early termination of the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Coronary Heart Disease","Percutaneous
