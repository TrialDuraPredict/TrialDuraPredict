The participant's healthcare priorities are then documented and transmitted to clinicians, in order to facilitate changes in the patient's care plan to align it with his/her priorities. In step 2, the clinician considers patient's priorities and potential healthcare options (options might include starting or stopping treatments; adding or removing medications; ordering more or fewer tests; recommending or removing self-management tasks). In step 3, the clinician discusses care options with the participant, using strategies for aligning care with patient priorities.","armGroupLabels":["Adapted Patient Priorities Care (PPC) approach plus Usual Care"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Usual Care","description":"Usual care for breast cancer survivorship includes regular visits with the oncology provider and yearly mammograms for surveillance.","armGroupLabels":["Adapted Patient Priorities Care (PPC) approach plus Usual Care","Usual Care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Treatment burden as assessed by the treatment burden questionnaire (TBQ)","description":"The treatment burden questionnaire (TBQ) measures perceptions of burden of overall care (for example, medication taking, self monitoring, visits to the provider, tests, tasks to access and coordinate care).
