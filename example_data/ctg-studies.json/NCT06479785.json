Many marble cutters in rural areas lack awareness of these risks and work without proper protection. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has over 4000 marble factories employing over a million laborers, mostly unskilled and vulnerable. Workers face health risks from heavy lifting, poor posture, and respirable dust. Ergonomic disorders are also common due to poorly designed workstations, repetitive motions, and straining postures. Musculoskeletal Symptoms (MSS) can progress into Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), affecting worker well-being and productivity. Findings can inform targeted educational programs and interventions to improve respiratory health and reduce ergonomic risks in the marble industry.","detailedDescription":"Occupational hazards, such as dust exposure during marble cutting, can significantly increase the risk of lung diseases in workers. This includes common ailments such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), as well as more serious conditions such as silicosis and asbestosis. Unfortunately, many marble cutters from rural areas may not be aware of these health risks, which can lead to them working without proper protection. Heavy load lifting, poor work posture, and the production of respirable dust in marble factories contribute to the health risks faced by these workers. Just like dust exposure during marble cutting can harm a worker's lungs, similarly, working in this industry carries a high risk of ergonomic disorders. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ergonomic risk factors are responsible for 35% of workplace injuries in 2021, resulting in MSDs. An extensive amount of research has been conducted globally; however, limited literature exists on this particular topic in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, specifically in Peshawar. The findings of the study can help inform the development and implementation of targeted educational programs and interventions aimed at improving respiratory health and reducing ergonomic risks in the marble industry."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Respiratory Diseases"],"keywords":["lung function, ergonomic hazards, marble factory workers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Educational intervention program on machine workers","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Use proper protective gears like mask, glasses, glove and proper foot wear.
