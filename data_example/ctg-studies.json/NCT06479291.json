It will also learn about the safety of HCQ plus TPO-RA. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nDoes HCQ plus TPO-RA raise the response rate in participants, compared to TPO-RA alone? Does HCQ plus TPO-RA prolong the response duration in participants, compared to Pred alone? Does HCQ plus TPO-RA decrease the dose of TPO-RA to maintain response in participants, compared to TPO-RA alone? What medical problems do participants have when taking HCQ plus TPO-RA? Researchers will compare HCQ plus TPO-RA with TPO-RA alone to see if HCQ plus TPO-RA works better to treat primary immune thrombocytopenia with positive anti-nuclear antibodies.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nTake TPO-RA every day for no more than 24 weeks, adjust the dose of TPO-RA according to the platelet level, with or without HCQ twice a day for 1 year; Visit the clinic once every 1 weeks for the first 8 weeks, and once every 2-4 weeks in the following 10 months for checkups and tests; Keep a diary of their symptoms","detailedDescription":"Primary immune thrombocytopenia (Primary immune thrombocytopenia, ITP) is an acquired autoimmune hemorrhagic disease characterized by a decreased peripheral platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. It has been reported that 33.3% -39.2% of ITP patients have positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in the course of the disease.In the meantime, they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for rheumatic diseases such as lupus erythematosus(SLE). ITP patients with positive ANA are prone to relapse and chronicity. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new clinical treatments to attain long-term remission in these patients.\n\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has immune modulating role on a variety of immune cells.A clinical trial enrolled immune thrombocytopenia secondary to SLE, and ITP with positive anti-nuclear antibodiy (ANA) were treated with HCQ combined with glucocorticoids. The results showed an overall response rate of 60% (24 / 40), including 18 continuous complete response (CR) and 6 continuous response (R), and some patients had continued elevated platelet counts 3 months after treatment initiation. The above studies illustrate that HCQ contributes to the treatment of chronic ITP, especially as a long-term therapeutic agent with low economic burden and good tolerance. In patients who do not response to HCQ plus corticosteroids, TPO-RA, a second line treatment, will be recommended. By now, no study has assess the efficacy and safety of HCQ plus TPO-RA in these patients. In the current study, the question will be answered."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Immune Thrombocytopenia With Positive ANA Antibodies"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":126,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HCQ plus TPO-RA group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group is experiment group.
