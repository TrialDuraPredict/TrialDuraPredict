Subjects must have been treated with established standard-of-care therapy, or physicians have determined that such established therapy is not sufficiently efficacious, or subjects have declined to receive standard-of-care therapy. In the latter case, the informed consent must state the effective therapies the subject is declining.\n5. Measurable disease (i.e., at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \\[RECIST 1.1\\])\n6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n7. Adequate organ function defined as:\n\n   a. Hepatic: i.

Subjects with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are eligible if they have an HBV viral load below the limit of quantification with or without concurrent viral suppressive therapy.\n13. Subjects with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be under curative antiviral treatment and have a viral load below the limit of quantification.\n14. Subjects in Part B (Cohort-Expansion) - must have one of the following tumor types to be enrolled in the respective cohort:\n\n    * Cohort 1: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\n\n      o Pathologically confirmed subjects with metastatic NSCLC with or without actionable genomic alterations.\n    * Cohort 2: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)\n    * Cohort 3: Gastric cancer\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Has significant clinical cardiac abnormality (e.g., clinical heart failure or unstable angina)\n10. Any medical comorbidity that is life-threatening or, in the opinion of the Investigator, renders the subject unsuitable for participation in a clinical trial due to possible noncompliance, would place the subject at an unacceptable risk (e.g. Interstitial lung disease (ILD)) and/or potential to affect interpretation of results of the study.\n11.
