It leads to symptoms like fainting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and heart failure, which can increase the risk of serious health issues and death.\n\nTranscatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a well-established treatment for severe AS, especially for patients who are at high risk for traditional open-heart surgery. TAVR is becoming more common and is now being used in younger and lower-risk patients due to its favorable outcomes.\n\nMany people with severe AS also have other heart conditions, and beta-blockers (B-blockers) are commonly used to manage these issues. B-blockers help treat heart failure, irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. About 34% to 51% of AS patients use B-blockers, but these medications can also cause side effects like slow heart rate and low blood pressure.\n\nThe need for a permanent pacemaker is the most common complication after TAVR, occuring in 9% to 26% of patients. This is because TAVR can affect the heart's electrical system. B-blockers might increase the risk of needing a pacemaker because they can further slow down the heart's electrical signals.\n\nTo reduce this risk, doctors sometimes stop B-blockers around the time of TAVR. However, this practice lacks support from clinical trials or guidelines, and stopping B-blockers can increase the risk of fast heartbeats and chest pain.\n\nThis aim of the clinical trial is to study the impact of B-blocker administration among patients undergoing TAVR. The trial will assess the safety of B-blocker discontinuation (primary endpoint) and by determining the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR (secondary endpoint).\n\nThe results of the trial will provide important insights into the optimal management of B-blockers in patients undergoing TAVR, potentially improving patient outcomes and guiding clinical practice."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Aortic Stenosis"],"keywords":["Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement","Beta-blockers"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":498,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pausing group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects in the pausing group will stop their B-blocker medication 72h before the scheduled transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure.
