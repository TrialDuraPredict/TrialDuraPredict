Full randomization will be performed by Excel software by generating random numbers using the \"Randomise (RAND)\" function The \"Fetal Reserve Index\" algorithm will be applied to the first group of patients. In in these patients the fetal reserve index will be calculated every 10 minutes. At each of the components of the score will be assigned a score of 1 if the variable evaluated is considered normal, 0 if classified as abnormal. The different scores obtained (score from 1 to 8) will be classified into 3 risk categories: Score 5-8: green zone, Score 3-4: zone yellow, Score 1-2: red zone. An FRI of 1-2 (red zone) is to be considered as anomalous. For patients with abnormal FRI a 40 minute timer will be started within which it will be necessary to exit the \"red zone\". If such patients will not be able to exit the red zone within 40 minutes, an additional timer will be started of 30 minutes within which the birth will be completed. The birth will be completed immediately in case of sentinel events (prolonged bradycardia, detachment of placenta, cord prolapse).\n\nThe second group of patients will, however, be managed according to the usual protocols internal management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Labor Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":290,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group A (FRI)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The \"Fetal Reserve Index\" algorithm will be applied to the first group of patients.
