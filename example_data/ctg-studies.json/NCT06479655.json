This study also aims to compare the outcomes of patients between the two groups.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are :\n\n1. Does propofol and fentanyl infusion as analgo-sedation achieve targeted sedation score at 12 and 24 hours compared to propofol and morphine infusion in mechanically ventilated adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)?\n2. Is there a difference between the proportion of patients requiring rescue sedation dose between the fentanyl and morphine groups?","detailedDescription":"Researchers will randomize patients into 2 groups (Fentanyl and Morphine) and will start study drug accordingly for sedation in ICU.Proportion of patients from each group achieving targeted sedation score at 12 and 24 hours following initiation of the drug and proportion of patients from each group requiring rescue sedation dose will be recorded and analyzed.\n\nFurthemore duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and 14 days mortality rate will recorded and compared between this 2 groups of patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Effect of Drug"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized control trial, two arms","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":116,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fentanyl","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Intravenous fentanyl infusion 0.5 -
