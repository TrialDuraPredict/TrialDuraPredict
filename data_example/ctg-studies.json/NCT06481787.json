The treatment of gastric acid inhibition and mucosal protection alone is not effective for patients with reflux combined with depression, and the additional administration of neuromodulatory drugs will increase the incidence of adverse reactions, so the combination of traditional Chinese medicine may be one of the effective ways to solve the above problems. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Zuojin Wan combined with vunorasan fumarate with that of vunorasan fumarate alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease","Depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Vonorasan fumarate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vonorasan fumarate, 20 mg twice daily orally before meals for 8 weeks of treatment.","interventionNames":["Drug: Vonorasan Fumarate"]},{"label":"Zuojin Pills combined with Vonorasan Fumarate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Add Zuojin Pills, 3g each time, twice daily, on top of Vonorasan Fumarate treatment for 8 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Vonorasan Fumarate","Drug: Zuojin Pills"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vonorasan Fumarate","description":"Vonorasan fumarate is taken 30min before breakfast and dinner.","armGroupLabels":["Vonorasan fumarate","Zuojin Pills combined with Vonorasan Fumarate"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Zuojin Pills","description":"Zuojin Pills should be taken 30min after breakfast and dinner.","armGroupLabels":["Zuojin Pills combined with Vonorasan Fumarate"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Reflux Disease Questionnaire","description":"According to the frequency and severity of episodes of the main symptomsï¼Œobserve the changes of reflux'disease questionnaire score before treatment and after 8 weeks of treatment.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Hamilton Depression Scale","description":"Assessing patients for depressive symptoms","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks"},{"measure":"Chinese Medicine Points Scale","description":"Assessment of TCM evidence before and after treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse events during treatment","description":"Ask the patient about the occurrence of adverse events while taking the medication","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
