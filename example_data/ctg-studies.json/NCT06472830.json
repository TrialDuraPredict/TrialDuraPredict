Monoclonal gammopathy is a condition where abnormal proteins are found in the blood, most commonly called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or MGUS. There is little information on the presence of this condition in people of East African descent. This study is being done to determine how this condition affects this population in order to better treat and/or prevent this condition in the future.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the prevalence of MGUS in people of East African descent in Minnesota.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an observational study.\n\nParticipants undergo medical chart review and blood sample collection, as well as complete a questionnaire on study.
