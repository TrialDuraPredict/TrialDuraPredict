This study is designed to assess the impact of a custom-formulated, hemp-derived, full-spectrum, high-CBD product vs. placebo on clinical symptoms and biomarkers over the course of 12 weeks of treatment in patients with endometriosis. This project will provide information that does not currently exist on the potential efficacy of a cannabinoid-based sublingual product for endometriosis.","detailedDescription":"Despite recent increases in both medical and recreational cannabis use in the United States and globally, little research has been conducted to determine the potential applications for womens health. Endometriosis impacts approximately 10% of women of reproductive age, an estimated 176 million individuals, and is characterized by endometrial cells growing outside of the uterus, resulting in severe pain, chronic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, infertility, and often, depression and anxiety (WHO, 2023). Existing treatment options are often limited in efficacy and may result in a variety of negative side effects. Previous research has indicated that cannabinoids including cannabidiol (CBD), delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and a number of other cannabinoids may hold potential for treating the symptoms of endometriosis, especially the chronic pain associated with the condition.\n\nThis study is a double-blind crossover clinical trial of a high-CBD product compared to placebo over a total of 12 weeks of treatment in patients with endometriosis. Participants will complete 7 visits over 12 weeks; 4 visits will be conducted in-person at McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA, and 3 visits will be conducted remotely. Visits consist of clinical ratings, assessments of conventional medication use, quality of life measures, and providing saliva, urine, and blood samples."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endometriosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-CBD Sublingual Product","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A custom-formulated, hemp-derived, full-spectrum high-CBD sublingual solution; 0.75mL of solution will be self-administered three times daily (TID) for the duration of the CBD phase.","interventionNames":["Drug: Cannabidiol"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo solution (0.75mL) will be self-administered TID for the duration of the placebo phase.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cannabidiol","description":"Custom formulation of a hemp-derived sublingual solution that is high in CBD and includes other cannabinoids and terpenes.","armGroupLabels":["High-CBD Sublingual Product"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"An active placebo containing supplemental terpenes matched to the high-CBD product.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Visual Analog Scale (VAS)","description":"The VAS is a commonly used pain scale where patients draw a line to indicate their pain level on a 100 millimeter long line anchored by two verbal descriptors for symptom extremes (e.g. \"no pain\" to \"worst imaginable pain\").
