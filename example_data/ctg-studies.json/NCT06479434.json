We wish to answer the question whether metformin is necessary to improve PCOS symptoms versus simple lifestyle modification.\n\nParticipants once diagnosed with PCOS will be given metformin to be sued for 8 weeks. They will be asked to provide blood samples on day 0 and after 8 weeks of metformin use. The blood sample will be used to measure the hormonal and inflammatory profile. In addition, they will be required to compete a questionnaire regarding symptoms such as decrease in facial hair growth, improvement in menstrual cycle etc."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","Insulin Resistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Metformin Treated PCO","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After taking informed consent demographic data like name, age, anthropometric measurements (blood pressure, BMI, weight, height)will be recorded by researcher Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist to hip ratio will be evaluated.
