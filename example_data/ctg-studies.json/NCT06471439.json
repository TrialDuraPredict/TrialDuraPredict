Exercise limitation is observed in COPD. Especially, decreased exercise performance related to vascular and fatique in quadriceps muscle. Exercise training is important for aerobic performance increasing. Generally results show exercise training with both lower limb. Increaed arterial stiffness and fatigue are observed in COPD. One leg exercise training result is not enough to highlight these parameters.\n\nThree types single leg exercise intervantion will be applied. Exercise capacity, muscle strength, lung function, electromyography, lactate and quality of life will be measured.","detailedDescription":"Three types single leg exercise intervantion will applied to COPD patients that devided three groups. One leg continuous exercise training will be aplied to one group. One leg HIIT exercise training will be aplied to other group. One leg resistance exercise training will be aplied to the last group.\n\nExercise capacity and muscle strength are assesed. Lung function is measured. Electormyography is recorded. Lactate and quality of life are measured."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Exercise"],"keywords":["Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Single Limb exercise","resistance training","continous
