To evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with Adebrelimab plus Apatinib for extensive small cell lung cancer after first-line induction of Adebrelimab plus chemotherapy.\n\nInduction Period: Participants received adebrelimab (1200 mg, iv., Day1) + carboplatin (AUC 4-5 mg/mL/min)/cisplatin (75 mg/m2) + etoposide (100 mg/m2, D1-3) for 4-6 cycles of three weeks.\n\nMaintenance phase: Participants received adebrelimab (1200mg, iv., Day1) + apatinib (250mg, po., daily) once every three weeks.\n\nFollow-up: If the participants have progression disease (PD) after maintenance therapy, based on the investigator's judgement that the participants may still benefit from continued treatment with adebrelimab in combination with apatinib, they may continue to receive maintenance therapy with or without other therapy until the PD or intolerable.\n\nThe primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include objective remission rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of remission (DoR), and overall survival (OS); PFS2 (defined as time from enrolment to second disease progression or death) Our study will also explore biomarkers including: haematopoietic factors (IL-6,IL-8, IL-10, etc.), PD-L1 expression, T-cell subsets, T-cell immunoprecision typing and regulatory T-cell counts. The data from our study will provide the basis for further prospective clinical trials (Phase III)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Adebrelimab+Chemotherapy→Adebrelimab+ Apatinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive adebrelimab plus carboplatin /cisplatin and etoposide during the induction phase (4-6 cycles of three weeks.).
