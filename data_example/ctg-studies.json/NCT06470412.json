This 6-month randomized controlled trial included 160 participants with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Participants were divided into two groups: one received DS based on physician judgment, and the other based on GenAIS AI system analysis. Primary outcomes focused on changes in disease activity, while secondary outcomes included quality of life, metabolic markers, and DS adherence. Data collection involved genetic, metabolic, and clinical profiling, with ethical considerations ensuring participant confidentiality and informed consent"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Autoimmune Diseases"],"keywords":["AI-guided dietary supplementation","Genetic profiling","Metabolic profiling","Disease reduction"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Control Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Control group"]},{"label":"AI-Guided Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: AI-Guided Group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Control group","description":"Participants receive supplement prescriptions from a physician based on current standard practices, which include biochemical markers, genetic data, and metabolic profiles.","armGroupLabels":["Control Group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"AI-Guided Group","description":"Participants receive supplement prescriptions determined by GenAIS, an AI system which considers genetic data, metabolic profiles, biochemical markers, and patient history.","armGroupLabels":["AI-Guided Group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The percent change in disease activity scores (DAS28 for rheumatoid arthritis, SLEDAI for lupus) for the AI-Guided group compared with the Control group.","description":"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), which has a score range from 0 to 105, to measure disease activity in participants with lupus.\n\nDisease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), which has a score range from 0 to 10, to measure disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis.","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percent change in specific symptoms of autoimmune disease","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Percent change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Percent change in body weight and BMI.","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Incidence of adverse effects related to dietary supplements.","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Participant adherence to the prescribed dietary supplements regimen","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Changes in quality of life score SF-36","description":"Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey, which has a score range from 0 to 100, to measure the quality of life in participants, with higher scores indicating better health and well-being.","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Changes in quality of life score WHOQOL-BREF","description":"World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), which has a score range from 0 to 100, to measure the quality of life in participants, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis) according to established clinical criteria.\n* Moderate to severe disease activity as indicated by standardized measures (e.g., DAS28 for rheumatoid arthritis, SLEDAI for lupus).\n* Stable on existing autoimmune medication regimen for at least 3 months prior to the study.\n* Willingness to provide genetic and metabolic data.\n* Written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Current or past history of severe psychiatric conditions or other severe chronic diseases.\n* Significant medical conditions like severe renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular diseases that may interfere with the study outcomes.\n* Use of dietary supplements that affect immune function within the last 3 months.\n* Pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n* Recent changes in autoimmune medication within the last 3 months.\n* Participation in another clinical trial within the last 30 days.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Center of New Medical Technologies","city":"Novosibirsk","state":"Novosibisk Region","zip":"630090","country":"Russian Federation","geoPoint":{"lat":55.0415,"lon":82.9346}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-07-01"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001327","term":"Autoimmune Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000007154","term":"Immune System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M4629","name":"Autoimmune Diseases","asFound":"Autoimmune Diseases","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10200","name":"Immune System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC20","name":"Immune System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false}
